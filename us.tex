\begin{abstract}
  A (vertex) $\ell$-ranking is a labelling $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of the vertices of a graph $G$ with integer colours so that for any path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ of length at most $\ell$, $\varphi(u_0)\neq\varphi(u_p)$ or $\varphi(u_0)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$.  We show that, for any fixed integer $\ell\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex planar graph has an $\ell$-ranking using $O(\log n/\log\log\log n)$ colours and this is tight even when $\ell=2$; for infinitely many values of $n$, there are $n$-vertex planar graphs, for which any 2-ranking requires $\Omega(\log n/\log\log\log n)$ colours.  This result also extends to bounded genus graphs.

  In developing this proof we obtain optimal bounds on the number of colours needed for $\ell$-ranking graphs of treewidth $t$ and graphs of simple treewidth $t$.  These upper bounds are constructive and give $O(n\log n)$-time algorithms.  Additional results that come from our techniques include new sublogarithmic upper bounds on the number of colours needed for $\ell$-rankings of apex minor-free graphs and $k$-planar graphs.

\section{Introduction}

% A sequence of integers $\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_p$ is \emph{ranked} if $\max\{\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_p\}$ occurs exactly once in $\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_p$.

A \emph{colouring} $\varphi:V(G)\to \N$ of a graph $G$ is an \emph{$\ell$-ranking} of $G$ if, for every non-trivial path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $G$ of length\footnote{The length of a path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is the number, $r$, of edges in the path. A path is \emph{trivial} if its length is 0 and non-trivial otherwise.} at most $\ell$,
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item $\varphi(u_0)\neq\varphi(u_p)$; or \item $\varphi(u_0)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$.
\end{inparaenum}
The $\ell$-ranking number $\chi_\ell(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(G)\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$.  Note that, for any $\ell\ge 1$ any $\ell$-ranking of $G$ is a proper colouring\footnote{A colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to \N$ is \emph{proper} if, for each edge $vw\in E(G)$, $\varphi(v)\neq\varphi(w)$ and the \emph{chromatic number}, $\chi(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that there exists a proper colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$ of $G$.} of $G$, so $\chi(G)\le \chi_\ell(G)$, and any proper colouring of $G$ is a 1-ranking of $G$, so $\chi(G)=\chi_1(G)$.

Besides the case $\ell=1$, two cases have received special attention: An $\infty$-ranking is called a \emph{vertex ranking} or \emph{ordered colouring}. The parameter $\chi_\infty(G)$ is called the \emph{vertex ranking number} of $G$ and has applications to matrix factorization \cite{bodlaender.gilbert.ea:approximating,duff.reid:multifrontal,liu:role,dereniowski.kubale:cholesky}, VLSI layout \cite{leiserson:area,sen.deng.ea:on}, and the analysis of online algorithms \cite{even.smorodinsky:hitting}. The case $\ell=2$ has also received special attention \cite{almeter.demircan.ea:graph,karpas.neiman.ea:on,shalu.antony:complexity}. A $2$-ranking is called a \emph{unique-superior colouring} by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} who prove the following result:

\setcounter{othertheorem}{19}
\begin{othertheorem}[\cite{karpas.neiman.ea:on}]\label{trees}
    For every $n$-vertex tree $T$, $\trn(T)\in O(\log n/\log\log n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex tree $T$ with $\trn(T)\in\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$.
\end{othertheorem}

The same authors prove the following result for planar graphs:

\setcounter{othertheorem}{15}
\begin{othertheorem}[\cite{karpas.neiman.ea:on}]\label{planar-graphs}
    For every integer $\ell$ and every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, $\lrn(G)\in O(\ell\log n)$.
\end{othertheorem}

Since every tree is a planar graph and no better lower bound is known for planar graphs, this leaves an obvious question:  Which is the correct bound for 2-ranking $n$-vertex planar graphs, $\log n$ or $\log n/\log\log n$?  As it turns out, the truth is somewhere in between.  Let $\log x :=\ln x$ denote the natural logarithm of $x$ and define $\log^{(0)}x:=x$ and, for any integer $i>0$, let $\log^{(i)}x:=\log(\log^{(i-1)} x)$. We prove:


\begin{thm}\label{planar}
    For any fixed integer $\ell\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has $\lrn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ with $\trn(G)\in \Omega(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$
\end{thm}

Our proof of the upper bound in \cref{planar} makes use of a recent \emph{product structure theorem} of \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar} which states that every planar graph $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P$ where $H$ is a planar planar graph of treewidth at most $3$, $K_3$ is a 3-cycle, $P$ is a path, and $\boxtimes$ denotes the strong graph product.\footnote{Definitions of $t$-trees, simple $t$-trees, treewidth, simple treewidth, and strong graph product appear later, in \cref{sec:basics}.}  To apply this theorem, we prove the following result:

\begin{thm}\label{simple-t-trees}
    For any fixed integers $\ell\ge 2$ and $t\ge 1$, every $n$-vertex graph $H$ of simple treewidth at most $t$ has $\lrn(H) \in O(\log n/\log^{(t)}n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for any fixed integer $t\ge 1$ and infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex graph $H$ of simple treewidth $t$ that has $\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(t)} n)$.
\end{thm}

The lower bound in \cref{simple-t-trees} immediately implies the lower bound in \cref{planar} because a graph has simple treewidth at most 3 if and only if it is planar and has treewidth at most 3. Therefore, the lower bound in \cref{simple-t-trees} shows the existence of $n$-vertex planar graphs $H$ with $\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$.

To obtain the upper bound in \cref{planar}, we apply the upper bound in \cref{simple-t-trees} to the graph $H$ defined by the product structure theorem along with a simple lemma which shows that, for any two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, $\lrn(G_1\boxtimes G_2)\le \lrn(G_1)\cdot\dlcn(G_2)$ where $\dlcn(G_2)$ is the \emph{distance-$\ell$ colouring number} of $G_2$;  the minimum number of colours needed to colour $G_2$ so that the endpoints of each non-trivial path of length at most $\ell$ have different colours.  It is easy to see that $\dlcn(K_3\times P)\le 3(\ell+1)$, so $\lrn(H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P)\le 3(\ell+1)\cdot\lrn(H)$.

Every graph of treewidth at most $t$ has simple treewidth at most $t+1$. Therefore, the upper bound in \cref{simple-t-trees} implies the (upper bound in the) following generalization of \cref{trees}:

\begin{thm}\label{t-trees}
    For any fixed integers $\ell\ge 2$, $t\ge 0$, every $n$-vertex graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$ has $\lrn(H) \in O(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for any fixed integer $t\ge 0$ and infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex graph $H$ of treewidth $t$ with $\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$.
\end{thm}

The lower bound in \cref{t-trees} is through a construction of a treewidth-$t$ graph $H$ with $\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$.  Again, since any graph of treewidth at most $t-1$ has simple treewidth at most $t$, the lower bound in \cref{t-trees} implies the lower bound in \cref{simple-t-trees}.

In addition to planar graphs, there are product structure theorems for a number of other graph classes, including bounded genus graphs, apex minor-free graphs, and $k$-planar graphs.  Using product structure theorems for these graph classes along with \cref{simple-t-trees,t-trees}, we obtain the following two results:

\begin{thm}\label{bounded-genus}
    For any fixed integer $\ell\ge 2$ and any integer $g\ge 0$, every $n$-vertex graph $G$ of Euler genus at most $g$ has $\lrn(G)\in O(g\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}\label{meta-theorem}\label{meta}
    For each of the following graph classes $\mathcal{G}$:
    \begin{compactenum}
        % \item the class of graphs that have non-crossing drawings in a surface of genus at most $g$;
        \item the class of graphs excluding a particular apex graph $A$ as a minor; and
        \item the class of graphs that can be drawn in a surface of genus $g$ with at most $k$ crossings per edge,
    \end{compactenum}
    there exists an integer $c=c(\mathcal{G})$ such that, for any fixed integer $\ell\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ has $\lrn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(c)} n)$.
\end{thm}



\subsection{Related Work}

For a graph $G$, a vertex $\infty$-ranking is known as a \emph{vertex ranking} \cite{bodlaender.deogun.ea:rankings} or \emph{ordered colouring} of $G$ \cite{katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered}.  Finding a vertex ranking $\varphi$ that uses exactly $\chi_\infty(G)$ colours is equivalent to finding a minimum-height elimination tree of $G$ \cite{torre.greenlaw.ea:optimal,deogun.kloks.ea:on}.  This measure has applications to parallel Cholesky factorization of matrices \cite{bodlaender.gilbert.ea:approximating,duff.reid:multifrontal,liu:role,dereniowski.kubale:cholesky} and in VLSI layout \cite{leiserson:area,sen.deng.ea:on}.  More recently, \citet{even.smorodinsky:hitting} showed that $\chi_\infty(G)$ determines the competitive ratio of the best algorithm for the online hitting set problem in $G$.

The \emph{vertex ranking problem} of determining $\chi_\infty(G)$ for an arbitrary graph $G$ is known to be NP-hard, even on some restricted classes of graphs \cite{bodlaender.deogun.ea:rankings,llewellyn.tovey.ea:local,llewellyn.tovey.ea:erratum,dereniowski.nadolski:vertex}. Polynomial-time algorithms for the vertex ranking problem have been found for several families of graphs: \citet{schaeffer:optimal} showed this for trees and \citet{deogun.kloks.ea:on} showed this for permutation graphs.

A straightforward application of divide-and-conquer using planar separators shows that, for any $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, $\chi_\infty(G) \in O(\sqrt{n})$ \cite{llewellyn.tovey.ea:local,katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered}, and this bound is optimal:  There exists $n$-vertex planar graphs $G$ with $\chi_\infty(G)\in \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ \cite{katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered}.  A lower bound of \citet{katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered} shows that upper bounds like this, using divide-and-conquer with separators, are essentially tight: If, for every $r$-element set $S\subseteq V(G)$, the graph $G-S$ has a component of size at least $\alpha n$, then $\chi_\infty(G) \in\Omega(\alpha r)$. In a similar vein, \citet{bodlaender.gilbert.ea:approximating,kloks:treewidth} show that $\chi_\infty(G)$ is lower bounded by 1 plus the pathwidth of $G$.

It is not hard to see that, even for an $n$-vertex path $P$, $\chi_\infty(P)\in\Omega(\log n)$.  The same separator argument, applied to treewidth-$t$ graphs shows that every $n$-vertex treewidth-$t$ graph $G$ has $\chi_\infty(G)\in O(t\log n)$.  This shows that, even for graphs with constant-size separators, (worst-case asymptotically) optimal bounds are obtained by divide-and-conquer using separators.  More references on vertex ranking are available in Section 7.19 of the dynamic survey by \citet{gallian:dynamic}.

\end{table}

At least three works have considered $\chi_\ell$ for finite $\ell$ with a focus on the case $\ell=2$.  These results are summarized in \cref{summary-table}.  Note that 2-rankings fall between two very well-studied graph colouring problems:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item \emph{star colourings}, which ensure that the graph induced by an 2 colour classes is forest of stars and
    \item \emph{distance-2 colourings} which ensure that the endpoints each non-trivial path of length at most 2 receive distinct colours.
\end{compactitem}
Every 2-ranking is a star colouring and every distance-2 colouring is a 2-ranking so, letting $\scn(G)$ and $\dtcn(G)$ denote the star colouring number of $G$ and distance-2 colouring number of $G$, respectively, we have $\scn(G) \le \trn(G)\le \dtcn(G)$.

\citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} proved \cref{trees}---a tight bound of $\trn(T)\in O(\log n/\log\log n)$ for every $n$-vertex tree $T$---and \cref{planar-graphs}---the upper bound $\trn(G)\in O(\log n)$ for every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$.  More generally, the same authors show that, for any proper minor-closed family $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs and, for every positive integer $\ell$, $\chi_\ell(G)\in O(\ell\log n)$ for every $n$-vertex $G\in\mathcal{G}$.  They also show that, for fixed $d$, every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ has $\trn(G)\in O(\sqrt{n})$ and there exists examples with $\trn(G)\in\Omega(n^{1/3})$.

\citet{shalu.antony:complexity} show that determining the minimum number of colours required by a 2-ranking of a given graph is NP-hard, even when restricted to planar bipartite graphs.  \citet{almeter.demircan.ea:graph} determine the exact value of $\trn(Q_d)=d+1$ where $Q_d$ is the $d$-cube.  They also shows that, for graphs $G$ of maximum degree 3, $\trn(G)\le 7$ and show the existence of a graph with maximum degree $k$ such that $\trn(G)\in\Omega(k^2/\log k)$.

It is not hard to see that any colouring $\varphi$ of $G$ is a vertex $\ell$-ranking if and only if, for every connected subgraph $X$ of $G$ having at most $\ell+1$ vertices, there is exactly one vertex $v\in V(X)$ such that $\varphi(v)=\max\{\varphi(v):v\in V(X)\}$.  This makes $\ell$-ranking a stronger notion than \emph{$\ell$-centered colouring}, which requires only that there exists some colour $\alpha$ such that there is exactly one vertex $v\in V(X)$ with $\varphi(v)=\alpha$ \cite{nesetril.ossona:tree-depth,nesetril.ossona:grad,zhu:colouring}. In this case, the difference between ``unique'' and ``unique maximum'' is surprisingly profound.  Planar graphs (and, indeed, all graphs families having similar product structure theorems) have $\ell$-centered colourings using a number of colours that depends only (polynomially) on $\ell$ \cite{nesetril.ossona:grad,debski.felsner.ea:improved,pilipczuk.siebertz:polynomial}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \Cref{sec:basics} reviews some basic tools used in the following sections.   \Cref{lower-bounds} proves the lower bound in \cref{t-trees}, which immediately implies the lower bounds in \cref{planar,simple-t-trees}. \Cref{upper-bounds} proves the upper bound in \cref{simple-t-trees}, from which the upper bounds in \cref{planar,t-trees,bounded-genus,meta} follow easily.  \Cref{conclusion} gives a brief summary and discusses directions for further work.

\section{Preliminaries}
\seclabel{basics}

In this paper we use standard graph theory terminology as used in the book by \citet{diestel:graph}
Every graph $G$ we consider is finite, simple, and undirected with vertex set denoted by $V(G)$ and edge set denoted by $E(G)$.  We use the shorthand $|G|:=|V(G)|$ to denote the number of vertices in $G$.  We use $N_G(v):=\{w\in V(G): vw\in E(G)\}$ to denote the \emph{open neighbourhood} of $v$ in $G$. For any $S\subseteq V(G)$, $N_G(S):=\bigcup_{v\in S} N_G(v)\setminus S$.  For each $n\in\N$, $K_n$ denotes the complete graph on $n$ vertices.  The \emph{length} of a path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $G$ is equal to the number, $p$, of edges in the path. A path is \emph{trivial} if it has length 0 and \emph{non-trivial} otherwise.

For any set $S$, $G[S]$ is the graph with vertex set $V(G[S]):=V(G)\cap S$ and edge set $E(G[S]):=\{vw\in E(G): \{v,w\}\subseteq S\}$, and $G-S:=G[V(G)\setminus S]$.  We say that a subgraph $G'$ of $G$ is an \emph{induced} subgraph of $G$ if $G[V(G')]=G'$.  For vertex rankings, it suffices to consider induced paths:

\begin{obs}\label{induced-paths-only}
    A colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of a graph $G$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $G$ if and only if, for every induced path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $G$ of length at most $\ell$,
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item $\varphi(u_0)\neq\varphi(u_p)$; or
        \item $\varphi(u_0)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$.
    \end{inparaenum}
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}
    By definition any $\ell$-ranking $\varphi$ of $G$ satisifies (i) or (ii) for every path of length at most $\ell$, including every induced path of length at most $\ell$, so this direction is trivial.

    For the other direction, suppose $G$ contains a (not necessarily induced) path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ of length $r\le\ell$ with $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$ and $\varphi(u_0)=\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$.  Let $w_0,\ldots,w_s$ be the shortest path from $w_0:=u_0$ to $w_s:=u_p$ in  the graph $G[\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}]$.  Then $w_0,\ldots,w_s$ is an induced path in $G$ with $\varphi(w_0)=\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)=\varphi(w_s)$ and, since $\{w_0,\ldots,w_{s}\}\subseteq\{u_0,\ldots,u_{r}\}$, $\max\{\varphi(w_0),\ldots,\varphi(w_{s})\}\le\max\{u_0,\ldots,u_{r}\}$, so $\varphi(w_0)=\varphi(u_0)=\max\{\varphi(w_0),\ldots,\varphi(w_s)\}$, as required.
\end{proof}

The same reasoning used to prove \cref{induced-paths-only} also shows:

\begin{obs}\label{walks-too}
    A colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of a graph $G$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $G$ if and only if, for every walk $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ in $G$ with $w_0\neq w_q$ of length at most $\ell$,
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item $\varphi(w_0)\neq\varphi(w_q)$; or
        \item $\varphi(w_0)<\max\{\varphi(w_0),\ldots,\varphi(w_q)\}$.
    \end{inparaenum}
\end{obs}


Let $T$ be a rooted tree rooted at some node $r\in V(T)$.  For any node $x\in V(T)$, $P_T(x)$ denotes the path, in $T$, from $r$ to $x$.  The \emph{$T$-depth} of $x\in V(T)$, denoted by $d_T(x)$, is the length of the path $P_T(x)$.  A node $a\in V(T)$ is a \emph{$T$-ancestor} of $x\in V(T)$ if $a\in V(P_T(x))$. If $a$ is a $T$-ancestor of $x$ then $x$ is a \emph{$T$-descendant} of $a$.  Note that every node of $T$ is both a $T$-ancestor and $T$-descendant of itself.  If $a$ is a $T$-ancestor of $x$ and $x\neq a$ then $a$ is a \emph{strict} $T$-ancestor of $x$ and $x$ is a \emph{strict} $T$-descendant of $a$.  The strict ancestor relation induces a partial order $\prec_T$ on $V(T)$ in which $x\prec_T y$ if and only if $x$ is a strict $T$-ancestor of $y$.

For any graph $G$, and any two vertices $v,w\in V(G)$, $d_G(v,w)$ denotes the length of the shortest path, in $G$, from $v$ to $w$. The \emph{diameter} of $G$ is $\diam(G):=\max\{d_G(v,w):v,w\in V(G)\}$. For any integer $k\ge 0$, the \emph{$k$-th power} of $G$, denoted by $G^k$, is the graph with vertex set $V(G^k):=V(G)$ and edge set $E(G^{k}):=\{vw:v,w\in V(G),\,d_G(v,w)\le k\}$.
% In the special case $k=2$, $G^2$ is called the \emph{square} of $G$.
Note that any distance-$\ell$ colouring of $G$ is a proper colouring of $G^\ell$ and vice-versa, i.e., $\dlcn(G)=\chi(G^\ell)$.

For any $v\in V(G)$ and any $W\subseteq V(G)$, let $d_H(v,W)=\min\{d_G(v,w):w\in W\}$. A \emph{BFS layering} of a connected graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into a sequence $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ of sets such that, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ and each $v\in L_i$, $d_G(v,L_0)=i$.  Any BFS layering $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ defines a partial order $\prec_{\mathcal{L}}$ on $V(G)$ in which $v\prec_{\mathcal{L}} w$ if and only if $v\in L_i$, $w\in L_j$ and $i<j$.

% A path $P:=u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $G$ is an \emph{induced} path if $G[\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}]$ is a path.



\subsection{Treewidth}

For two graphs $H$ and $X$, an \emph{$X$-decomposition} of $H$ is a sequence $\mathcal{X}:=(B_x:x\in V(X))$ of subsets of $V(H)$ called \emph{bags} indexed by the nodes of $X$ and such that
 \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
     \item for each $v\in V(H)$, $X[\{x\in V(X):v\in B_x\}]$ is connected; and
     \item for each $vw\in E(H)$, there exists some $x\in V(X)$ such that $\{v,w\}\subseteq B_x$.
\end{inparaenum}
The \emph{width} of $\mathcal{X}$ is $\max\{|B_x|:x\in V(X)\}-1$. We say that $H$ is \emph{edge-maximal} with respect to $\mathcal{X}$ if, for each $x\in V(X)$, the vertices in $B_x$ form a clique in $H$. The $X$-decomposition $\mathcal{X}$ is \emph{smooth} if, for each edge $xy\in E(X)$, $|B_x\setminus B_y|\le 1$ and $|B_y\setminus B_x|\le 1$.

In the special case where $X$ is a tree (or a forest), $\mathcal{X}$ is called a \emph{tree decomposition} of $H$.  In the still more special case where $X$ is a path (or a collection of disjoint paths), $\mathcal{X}$ is called a \emph{path decomposition} of $H$. The \emph{treewidth} $\tw(H)$ of $H$ is the minimum width of any tree decomposition of $H$. The \emph{pathwidth} $\pw(H)$ of $H$ is the minimum width of any path decomposition of $H$.

For a graph $H$, a \emph{rooted} tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ is one in which $T$ is a rooted tree.  Throughout the remainder of the paper, all our tree decompositions are rooted, with the root of $T$ typically denoted by $r$, in which case we call it an $r$-rooted tree decomposition.  We use the notation $x_T(v)$ to denote the minimum $T$-depth node $x\in V(T)$ such that $v\in B_x$.  This induces a partial order $\prec_{\mathcal{T}}$ on $V(H)$ in which $v\prec_{\mathcal{T}} w$ if and only if $x_T(v)\prec_T x_T(w)$.  The following observations have straightforward proofs:

 \begin{obs}\label{induced-unimodal}
     Let $H$ be a graph that is edge-maximal with respect to some rooted tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$.  Then, for any induced path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $H$, $u_i\preceq_\mathcal{T} u_0$ or $u_i\preceq_\mathcal{T} u_p$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$.
 \end{obs}


\begin{obs}\label{order-relation}
    Let $H$ be a connected graph that is edge-maximal with respect to an $r$-rooted tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ and let $\mathcal{L}:=L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=B_r$.  Then, for any $v,w\in V(H)$, $v\prec_{\mathcal{T}}w$ implies $v\preceq_{\mathcal{L}}w$. Equivalently, there is no pair $v,w\in V(H)$ such that $v\prec_{\mathcal{L}}w$ and $w\prec_{\mathcal{T}}v$.
\end{obs}

\begin{obs}\label{up-neighbours}
    Let $H$ be a connected graph that is edge-maximal with respect to a width-$t$ $r$-rooted tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ and let $\mathcal{L}:=L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=B_r$. Then, for any component $X$ of $H[\bigcup_{j=i}^m L_j]$, $|L_{i-1}\cap N_H(V(X))|\le t$.
\end{obs}

% \begin{proof}
%     By \cref{order-relation}, $w\preceq_\mathcal{T} v$ for each $w\in N_H(v)\cap L_i$.  Proprety~(i) of tree decompositions therefore implies that $N_H(v)\cap L_{i-1}\subseteq B_{x_T(v)}$.  Therefore $t+1\ge |B_{x_T(v)}| \ge |N_H(v)\cap L_{i-1}|+1$, as required.
% \end{proof}


We will make use of the following well-known and easy to prove vertex-weighted separator lemma:

\begin{lem}\label{weighted-separator}
    Let $H$ be a graph; let $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ be a tree decomposition of $H$; and let $\xi:V(H)\to\R$ be a function that is positive on $V(H)$.  Then, for any integer $c>1$, there exists $S_T\subseteq V(T)$ of size $|S_T|\le c$ such that, for each component $X$ of $H-(\bigcup_{x\in S_T} B_x)$, $\sum_{v\in V(X)} \xi(v) \le \tfrac{1}{c}\cdot\sum_{v\in V(H)} \xi(v)$.
\end{lem}

% \begin{proof}
%     (This proof is only included for the sake of being self-contained.)
%     Define $n_0:=\tfrac{1}{c}\cdot\sum_{v\in V(H)} \xi(v)$ and, for a subtree $T'$ of $T$, let $n_{T'}:=\sum_{y\in \bigcup_{x\in V(T')}B_x]} B_y$.  Let $T^{(0)}:=T$, let $i:=0$ and repeat the following steps until $n_{T^{(i)}} < n_0$:
%     \begin{compactenum}
%         \item Find a node $x_{i}\in V(T^{(i)})$ of maximal $T^{(i)}$-depth such that the subtree $T^{(i)}_{x_i}$ of $T^{(i)}$ containing $x_i$ and its $T^{(i)}$-descendants has $n_{T^{(i)}_{x_i}} > n_0$.
%
%         \item Set $T^{(i+1)}$ to be the component of $T^i-\{x_i\}$ containing $r$ and set $i:=i+1$.
%     \end{compactenum}
%     The key observation is that, since $x_i$ is of maximal depth, each component $X$ of $T^{(i)}-\{x_i\}$ other than $T^{(i+1)}$ has $n_X\le n_0$.
%     This procedure certainly terminates after at most $n_T/n_0 = O(c)$ steps and the set $S_T:=\{x_0,\ldots,x_p\}$ has the required properties.
% \end{proof}

\subsection{Simple Treewidth}


A tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of a graph $H$ is \emph{$t$-simple} if it has width $t$ and, for every $t$-element subset $S\subseteq V(H)$, $|\{x\in V(T):S\subseteq B_x\}|\le 2$.  The simple treewidth $\stw(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $H$ has a $t$-simple tree decomposition \cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple}.  \citet{knauer.ueckerdt:simple} define simple treewidth and the thesis of \citet{wulf:stacked} studies it extensively.
% \citet{markenzon.justel.ea:subclasses} define simple $t$-trees (which they call Simple Clique (SC) $t$-trees).

% Simple treewidth is minor-monotone. This is stated by \citet{knauer.ueckerdt:simple} and \citet[Theorem~5.2]{wulf:stacked} gives a proof:
%
% \begin{lem}[\cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple,wulf:stacked}]\label{simple-minor-closed}
%     For every graph $G$ and every minor $M$ of $G$, $\stw(M)\le\stw(G)$.
% \end{lem}

We work with simple treewidth because it arises naturally in the graphs we are interested in:

\begin{lem}[\cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple,markenzon.justel.ea:subclasses}]\label{simple-small-cases}
    For any graph $H$,
    \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
        \item $\stw(H)\le 1$ if and only if $H$ is a collection of paths;
        \item $\stw(H)\le 2$ if and only if $H$ is outerplanar;
        \item $\stw(H)\le 3$ if and only if $\tw(H)\le 3$ and $H$ is planar.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

Simple treewidth and treewidth are closely related:

\begin{lem}[\cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple}]\label{simple-treewidth-vs-treewidth}
    For every graph $G$, $\tw(G)\le \stw(G)\le \tw(G)+1$.
\end{lem}

% The following two results show that, although not immediately obvious, simple treewidth and simple $t$-trees behave very much like treewidth and $t$-trees.  The first result, due to \citet[Theorem~3.27]{wulf:stacked}, shows that every graph of simple treewidth at most $t$ is a spanning subgraph of some simple $t$-tree.\footnote{The statement of \cite[Theorem~3.27]{wulf:stacked} does not explicitly state that $V(G)=V(H)$, but it is the case.  The relevant location is the proof that (iii)$\Rightarrow$(i) in Theorem~3.25 where, by definition, $V(\mathrm{fill}(H))=V(G)$.}
%
% [TODO: We can get away without this, so let's clean it up when we get the chance.]
% \begin{lem}[\cite{wulf:stacked}]\label{simple-subgraph}
%     For any graph $G$ with $\stw(G)\le t$, there exists a simple $t$-tree $H$ with $V(G)= V(H)$ and $E(G)\subseteq E(H)$.
% \end{lem}

A proof of the following lemma, using minor-monotonicity \cite[Theorem~5.2]{wulf:stacked}, is due to \citet{wood:personal}.

\begin{lem}[\cite{wood:personal}]\label{simple-bfs-layers}
    Let $H$ be a connected graph that is edge-maximal with respect to some $r$-rooted $t$-simple tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ and let $L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be the BFS ordering of $H$ with $L_0:=B_r$.   Then, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, $\stw(H[L_i])\le t-1$.
\end{lem}


\subsection{Product Structure}

For two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the \emph{strong graph product} of $G_1$ and $G_2$, denoted $G_1\boxtimes G_2$, is a graph whose vertex set is the Cartesian product $V(G_1\boxtimes G_2):= V(G_1)\times V(G_2)$ and that contains an edge between $v=(v_1,v_2)$ and $w=(w_1,w_2)$ if and only if
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item $v_1=w_1$ and $v_2w_2\in E(G_2)$;
    \item $v_2=w_2$ and $v_1w_1\in E(G_1)$; or
    \item $v_1w_1\in E(G_1)$ and $v_2w_2\in E(G_2)$.
\end{inparaenum}

The following recent result of \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}, which builds on earlier work of \citet{pilipczuk.siebertz:polynomial}, shows that every planar graph is the subgraph of a strong product of very simple graphs.

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}]\label{product-structure}
    For every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, there exists a graph $H$, $|H|\le n$, $\stw(H)\le 3$, and a path $P$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P$.
\end{thm}

As the following simple lemma shows, product structure is highly relevant to $\ell$-ranking:

\begin{lem}\label{product-lemma}
    For any two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, $\lrn(G_1\boxtimes G_2)\le \lrn(G_1)\cdot\dlcn(G_2)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    For each $(x,y)\in V(G_1\boxtimes G_2)$, let $\varphi(x,y):=\dlcn(G_2)\cdot \rho(x) - \psi(y)$ where $\rho:V(G_1)\to\{1,\ldots,\lrn(G_1)\}$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $G_1$ and $\psi:V(G_2)\to\{0,\ldots,\dlcn(G_2)-1\}$ is a distance-$\ell$ colouring of $G_2$.

    To see that $\varphi$ is a $\ell$-ranking, consider any
    path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $G_1\boxtimes G_2$ of length $r\le\ell$ such that $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$.  We must show that $\varphi(u_0)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$.

    For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,p\}$, let $(u_{i,1},u_{i,2}):=u_i$, so that $u_{i,1}\in V(G_1)$ and $u_{i,2}\in V(G_2)$. Since $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$, $\rho(u_{0,2})=\rho(u_{p,2})$. Since $\Psi$ is a distance-$\ell$ colouring of $G_2$ and $r\le\ell$, this implies that $u_{0,2}=u_{p,2}$.  This implies that $u_{0,1}\neq u_{p,1}$, otherwise $u_0=u_p$ and $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is not a path.  Therefore, $u_{0,1},\ldots,u_{p,1}$ is a walk in $G_1$ with distinct endpoints.
    Since $\rho$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $G_1$, \cref{walks-too} implies that $\rho(u_{0,1})<\max\{\rho_{u_0,1},\ldots,u_{p,1}\}$ and therefore $\varphi(u)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$, as required.
\end{proof}

Note that the graph $K_3\boxtimes P$, which appears in \cref{product-structure}, has maximum degree 8 so $(K_3\boxtimes P)^\ell$ has maximum degree at most $8\cdot 7^{\ell-1}$.  Since distance-$\ell$ colouring any graph is $G$ equivalent to properly colouring $G^{\ell}$, this implies that $\dtcn(K_3\boxtimes P)\le 8\cdot7^\ell$. The following lemma improves this constant using the fact that $(K_3\boxtimes P)^\ell$ is $3\ell+2$ degenerate (as can be seen by ordering vertices of $(K_3\boxtimes P)$ by the order that their second coordinate appears in $P$).

\begin{lem}\label{dumb}
    For any path $P$, $\dlcn(K_3\boxtimes P)\le 3(\ell+1)$.
\end{lem}

% \begin{proof}
%     Order the vertices of $K_3\boxtimes P$ as $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_{3|P|},y_{3|P|})$ so that, if $y_i$ appears before $y_j$ in $P$, then $i<j$. For each $j\in\{1,\ldots,3|P|\}$, let $I_j\subset\{1,\ldots,j-1\}$ be the set of indices $i$ such that $K_3\boxtimes P$ contains a non-trivial path of length at most $\ell$ with endpoints $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$.  It is easy to verify that $|I_j|\le 3(\ell+1)$.  For each $j\in\{1,\ldots,3|P|\}$, set $\varphi(x_j,y_j):=\min(\{1,\ldots,3(\ell+1)\}\setminus\{\varphi(x_i,y_i):i\in I_j\})$.  This gives a distance-$\ell$ colouring $\varphi:K_3\boxtimes P\to\{1,\ldots,3(\ell+1)\}$.
% \end{proof}
%

\subsection{Inequalities for Iterated Logarithms}

For any $x> 0$ and $a\ge 0$, we have the inequality,
\begin{equation}
    \log (x+a) = \log (x(1+a/x)) = \log x + \log(1+a/x) \le \log x + \log e^{a/x} = \log x + \frac{a}{x} \enspace , \label{log-x-plus-a}
\end{equation}
where the inequality follows from the inequality $e^z \le 1+z$, valid for all $z\in\R$.

Recall that, for any integer $i\ge 0$,
\[
    \log^{(i)} x :=
      \begin{cases}
          x & \text{for $i=0$} \\
          \log\left(\log^{(i-1)}x\right) & \text{for $i\ge 1$.} \\
      \end{cases}
\]
Define the \emph{$\tau$ower} function $\tau:\N\to\N$ by
\[
  \tau(i) :=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for $i=0$} \\
        e^{\tau(i-1)} & \text{for $i\ge 1$.} \\
    \end{cases}
\]
Note that, for all $i\in\N$, $\log^{(i)}\tau(i)=1$.

For any $x > \tau(i-1)$ and any $a\ge 0$, \cref{log-x-plus-a} generalizes as follows (by induction on $i$):
\begin{equation}
    \log^{(i)}(x+a) \le \log^{(i)} x + \frac{a}{\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}\log^{(j)} x} \label{logi-x-plus-a}
\end{equation}

In several places we have ratios involving iterated logarithms, in which case we make use of the following consequence of \cref{logi-x-plus-a}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\log^{(i)} x+a}{\log^{(i)} x} \le 1 + \frac{a}{\prod_{j=0}^{i}\log^{(j)} x} \enspace, \label{logi-ratio}
\end{equation}
which is again valid for all $x> \tau(i-1)$.

\subsection{The $\gamma_{i,k}$ Function}


For any integer $i$, any real $k>\tau(i-1)$, and any real $n\in[1,(\log^{(i)} k)^k]$, we define $\gamma_{i,k}(n)$ to be the solution $x$ to the equation $(\log^{(i)} k)^k/(\log^{(i)} x)^{x}=n$.  The value of $\gamma_{i,k}(n)$ is well defined and $\tau(i)\le \gamma_{i,k}(n)\le k$, for the following reasons:  For $x\in[\tau(i),k]$, the left hand side is a continuous strictly decreasing function of $x$. Setting $x=\tau(i)$, the left hand side becomes $(\log^{(i)} k)^k \ge n$. Setting $x=k$, the left hand side becomes $1\le n$.


%========================================================================
\section{Lower Bounds}
\label{lower-bounds}

We now prove the lower bound in \cref{t-trees}, which establishes all the other lower bounds. The idea in this lower bound is to construct a graph $G$ that has a BFS layering $L_0,\ldots,L_m$ such that, for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$ and each vertex $a\in L_i$, $G[N_G(a)\cap L_{i+1}]$ is a collection of treewidth-$(t-1)$ graphs $U_{a,0},\ldots,U_{a,k}$, each of which is a copy of a small treewidth-$(t-1)$ graph $U$ that requires at least $h$ colours.  This forces the colour of $a$ to exceed, by at least $h+1$, the smallest colour used in $U_{a,0},\ldots,U_{a,k}$.  Proceeding bottom up, this forces the vertex in $L_0$ to receive a colour larger than $(h+1)m$.  The lower bound is then obtained by using induction on $t$ to upper bound the size of the graph $U$ needed to ensure that $\trn(U)\ge h$ and choosing the parameters $h$ and $m$ appropriately.

\begin{lem}\label{apex-graph}
    Let $h,k\ge 1$ be integers, let $U$ be a graph with $\trn(U)\ge h$ and let $G$ be a graph obtained by taking $k+1$ disjoint copies $U_0,\ldots,U_k$ of $U$ and adding an apex vertex $a$ adjacent to each $v\in\bigcup_{i=0}^k V(U_i)$.  Then, for any integer $k_0\in \{1,\ldots,k\}$ and any 2-ranking of $\varphi:V(G)\to\{k_0,\ldots,k\}$, $\varphi(a) \ge k_0+h$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $\trn(U_i)\ge h$, there exists $v_i\in V(U_i)$ such that $\varphi(v_i)\ge k_0+h-1$, for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,k\}$.  Since $|\{0,\ldots,k\}|=k+1>k-k_0+1=|\{k_0,\ldots,k\}|$ the Pigeonhole Principle implies that there exists distinct $i,j\in\{0,\ldots,k\}$ such that $\varphi(v_i)=\varphi(v_j)$.  Since $v_i a v_j$ is a path in $G$, this implies that $\varphi(a)\ge \varphi(v_i)+1\ge k_0+h$.
\end{proof}

For a graph $U$ and integers $h,m\ge 0$, we define the \emph{$(h,m)$-boost} $U^{(h,m)}$ of $U$ as follows: The vertex set of $U^{(h,m)}$ is the disjoint union of $L_0,\ldots,L_m$.  The set $L_0:=\{a_0\}$ consists of a single vertex. For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ and each $a\in L_{i-1}$, $U^{(h,m)}$ contains $hm+1$ disjoint copies $U_{a,0},\ldots,U_{a,hm}$ of $U$ and contains the edge $av$ for each $v\in\bigcup_{j=0}^{hm} V(U_{a,j})$.  This determines the set $L_i=\bigcup_{a\in L_{i-1}}\bigcup_{j=0}^{hm} V(U_{a,j})$.  As a simple example, if $U$ is a 1-vertex graph, then $U^{(h,m)}$ is a complete $(hm+1)$-ary tree of height $m$.

\begin{lem}\label{boost}
    For any graph $U$, any integer $m\ge 0$, and any $h\le\trn(U)$, $\trn(U^{(h,m)})\ge hm +1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\trn(U^{(h,m)})=k<hm+1$ and let $\varphi:V(U^{(h,m)})\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$ be a 2-ranking of $U_{(h,m)}$.  Let $L_0,\ldots,L_{m}$ be the partition of $V(U^{(h,m)})$ used in the definition of $U^{(h,m)}$. We will show by induction on $m-i$ that, for each $a\in L_{i}$, $\varphi(a)\ge(m-i)h+1$. This gives the desired contradiction since it implies that, for the unique vertex $a_0\in L_0$, $\varphi(a_0)\ge m h+1 > k$.

    The base case of the induction, $m-i=0$, is trivial; it simply asserts that $\varphi(v)\ge 1$ for each $v\in L_m$.  For any $i\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$ we apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that $\varphi(v)\in\{(m-i-1)h+1,\ldots,k\}$ for each $v\in L_{i+1}$.  For each $a\in L_i$, the subgraph of $U^{(h,m)}$ induced by $a$ and its neighbours in $L_{i+1}$ contains the graph described in \cref{apex-graph} with $k_0:=(m-i-1)h+1$.  The conclusion of \cref{apex-graph} therefore implies that $\varphi(a)\ge k_0+h=(m-i)h+1$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{boost-size}
    For any graph $U$ and any integers $h,m \ge 1$, $|U^{(h,m)}| \le (|U|\cdot h\cdot m)^{m}\cdot (1+O((|U|hm)^{-1})$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    It is easy to see that, for each $i\in \{0,\ldots,m\}$, $|L_i|=(|U|(hm+1))^i$.  Therefore,
    \[ |U^{h,m}| = \sum_{i=0}^m |L_i| = \sum_{i=0}^m (|U|(hm+1))^i = (|U|(hm))^{m}\cdot (1+O((|U|hm)^{-1}) \enspace . \qedhere
    \]
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{boost-treewidth}
    For any graph $U$ and any integers $h,m\ge 1$, $\tw(U^{(h,m)})\le \tw(U)+1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $t:=\tw(U)$.
  Create a width-$(t+1)$ tree-decomposition $(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $U^{(h,m)}$ as follows: Start with $T$ having a single node $z_0$ with $B_{z_0}=L_0$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, and each $a\in L_{i-1}$, find some bag $B_z$ in the current decomposition that contains $a$, take $h+1$ disjoint copies $(A_x:x\in V(T_0)),\ldots,(A_x:x\in V(T_h))$ of some width-$t$ tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of $U$.  For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,h\}$, add an edge from $z$ to any node of the tree in $T_i$ and add $a$ to every bag in $T_i$.  It is straightforward to verify that this does, indeed, give a width-$(\tw(U)+1)$ tree-decomposition of $U^{(h,m)}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{treewidth-lower-bound}
    For each integer $t\ge 1$ and any integer $r\ge \tau(t)$, there exists a graph $G$, with $|G|\le (\log^{(t-1)}r)^{tr + o(r)}$, $\tw(G)\le t$, and $\trn(G)\ge r$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $t$.  The base case $t=1$ has already been established by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} who show that the complete $(r+1)$-ary tree $T$ of height $r-1$ has $\trn(T)\ge r$.  The tree $T$ has size $\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} (r+1)^i \le r^r=(\log^{(0)}r)^{r}$.  This establishes the result for $t=1$.

    Let $h:=\lceil\log r\rceil$ and $m:=\lceil r/\log r\rceil$ so that $hm\ge r$.  For $t>1$ we can apply the inductive hypothesis to obtain a graph $U$, with $\tw(U)\le t-1$, $|U|=(\log^{(t-2)} h)^{(t-1)h+o(h)}$ and $\trn(U)\ge h$.
    Now we take the graph $G:=U^{(h,m)}$.  By \cref{boost-treewidth}, $\tw(G)\le \tw(U)+1\le t$.  By \cref{boost},
    $\trn(G)\ge hm+1 > hm \ge r$.

    % In the following calculation we ignore the ceilings in the definitions of $h$ and $m$.
    By \cref{boost-size},
    \begin{align*}
        |G| & \le (|U|\cdot m\cdot h)^{m} \\

        & = (\log^{(t-2)} h)^{(t-1)r + o(r)}\cdot r^{m+o(m)}
        & \text{(since $h=\lceil\log r\rceil$ and $m=\lceil r/\log r\rceil$)}\\
        & = (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{(t-1)r + o(r)}\cdot r^{m+o(m)}
         & \text{(since $h=\lceil\log r\rceil$)} \\

        & \le (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{tr + o(r)} & \text{(since $r\ge \tau(t)$, so $\log^{(t-1)} r\ge e$).} & \qedhere

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{t-trees} (lower bound)]
    \Cref{treewidth-lower-bound} produces a graph $G$, $n:=|G|\le (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{tr+o(r)}$, $\tw(G)\le t$, and $\trn(G)\ge r$.  So,
    \[  \log n \le (tr+o(r))\log^{(t)} r = t\cdot(1+o(1))\trn(G)\log^{(t)} \trn(G)\]
    and attempting to solve for $\trn(G)$ shows that $\trn(G)\in \Omega(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$.
\end{proof}

The lower bound construction in this section gives some guidance on how to obtain a matching upper bound for $\trn(G)$.  Specifically, for some node $a\in L_i$, the colouring of the component $X$ of $H[\{a\}\cup\bigcup_{j=i+1}^m L_j]$ that contains $a$ can create a lower bound on $\varphi(a)$.  Specifically, if two vertices $u,w\in V(X[L_{i+1}]$ receives the same colour $\phi$ then $\varphi(a)>\phi$.  This suggests that one should attempt to minimize the largest colour that this is repeated in the colouring of $X[L_{i+1}]$.  Indeed, this is a guiding principle in our upper bound proof.

\section{Upper Bounds}
\label{upper-bounds}

In this section we prove asymptotically tight bounds for the worst-case number of colours needed for $\ell$-ranking simple treewidth-$t$ graphs, treewidth-$t$ graphs, planar graphs, and bounded genus graphs. From this point onward, we treat $\ell$ and $t$ as fixed constants independent of $n$ and other parameters that are unbounded, so that $f(\ell,t)\in O(1)$ for any function $f:\N\times\N\to\N$.

\subsection{Simple Treewidth-$t$ Graphs}

This section is devoted to proving the upper bound in \cref{simple-t-trees}:

\begin{namedtheorem}[\weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}]\weirdlabel{simple-t-trees}{a}
    For fixed integers $\ell\ge 2$, $t\ge 1$, every $n$-vertex graph $H$ with $\stw(H)\le t$ has $\lrn(H)\in O(\log n/\log^{(t)} n)$.
\end{namedtheorem}

\weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} immediately implies the upper bounds in \cref{planar,t-trees}:

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{planar} (upper bound)]
    By \cref{product-structure}, $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P$ where $|H|\le n$, $\stw(H)\le 3$, and $P$ is a path. Therefore,
    \begin{align*}
        \lrn(G) & \le \lrn(H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P)
                    & \text{(by \cref{product-structure})}\\
                & \le \lrn(H)\cdot \dlcn(K_3\boxtimes P)
                    & \text{(by \cref{product-lemma})} \\
                & \le 3(\ell+1)\cdot\lrn(H) & \text{(by \cref{dumb})} \\
                & \in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n) & \text{(by \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}).} & \qedhere
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{t-trees} (upper bound)]
    By \cref{simple-treewidth-vs-treewidth}, $\stw(H)\le\tw(H)+1\le t+1$ so, by   \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}, $\trn(H)\in O(n\log^{(t+1)}n)$.
\end{proof}

\weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} also has the following corollary, which strengthens \cref{trees}:

\begin{cor}\label{outerplanar}
    For each fixed integer $\ell\ge 2$, every $n$-vertex outerplanar graph $G$ has $\lrn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(2)} n)$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    By \cref{simple-small-cases}{(ii)}, $\stw(G)\le 2$ so, by \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} $\lrn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(2)} n)$.
\end{proof}

The proof of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} is the most technically demanding part of the paper and is the subject of most of this section.  Globally, the proof is by induction on the value of $t$, though it is easy to miss this, since it is spread over several lemmas. The case $t=1$ is easy: By \cref{simple-small-cases}(i), any graph of simple treewidth 1 is a contained in a path and therefore has an $\ell$-ranking using $\ell+1\in O(\log n/\log^{(1)} n) = O(1)$ colours.  In the proof of \cref{t-tree-slack}, below, we will apply \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} to graphs of simple treewidth $t-1$. \cref{t-tree-slack} is then used in the proof of \cref{t-tree-technical} which is used in the proof of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} (a statement about graphs of simple treewidth $t$), at the end of this section.

\subsubsection{The Bread}

We begin with a few helper lemmas.

\begin{lem}\label{pathwidth}
    For any graph $G$, $\lrn(G)\le (\ell+1)\pw(G) + 1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $\pw(G)$.  The base case $\pw(G)=0$ is trivial: In this case, $G$ contains no edges and can be $\ell$-ranked with $1 = (\ell+1)\pw(G)+1$ colours.

    For $\pw(G)>1$, it is well known that $G$ contains a sequence of vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_m$  such that
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item $G$ contains no edge $v_iv_j$ with $|i-j|>1$;
        \item $G$ contains no path $v_iw v_j$ with $w\not\in\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ and $|i-j|>1$; and
        \item $\pw(G-\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\})\le \pw(G)-1$.
    \end{inparaenum}
    Property~(iii) implies that we can therefore inductively colour $G-\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ using colours $\{1,\ldots,(\ell+1)(\pw(G)-1)+1\}$ and then colour each $v_i$ with colour $(\ell+1)(\pw(G)-1)+2+i\bmod (\ell+1)$.  Property~(i) ensures that this gives a $\ell$-ranking of $G[v_1,\ldots,v_m]$.  Property~(ii) and the fact that $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ are coloured using larger colours than those used to colour $G-\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ ensures that the resulting colouring is an $\ell$-ranking of $G$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{path-induced}
    Let $P=x_1,\ldots,x_m$ be a path and let $G$ be a graph that is edge-maximal with respect to a width-$t$ $P$-decomposition $\mathcal{P}:=(B_x:x\in V(P))$ of $G$.  Then there exists a set $U\subseteq V(G)$ such that
    \begin{compactenum}[(Z1)]
        \item $B_{x_1}\cup B_{x_m}\subseteq U$;\label{values-u}
        \item $|U|\in O(\ell^t)$; and \label{size-u}
        \item for each non-trivial induced path $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ in $G$ that has length at most $\ell$ and $\{w_0,w_q\}\in U$, $\{w_1,\ldots,w_{q-1}\}\subseteq U$.\label{induced-u}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    To eliminate a level of subscripts, let $x_i:=i$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$.  The proof is by induction on $t$. In the base case, $t=0$, $G$ has no edges and therefore no non-trivial paths. The lemma is satisfied by taking $U:=B_{1}\cup B_{m}$.  In this case $|U|\le 2\in O(\ell^0)$.

    Now assume that $t\ge 1$. If $G$ is not connected, then $B_{1}$ and $B_{m}$ are in difference components of $G$.  Choosing $U:=B_{1}\cup B_{m}$ satisfies the requirements of the lemma since the only paths $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ that need consideration have $\{w_0,w_q\}\subseteq B_1$ or $\{w_0,w_q\}\subset B_m$.  Since we only consider induced paths in $G$ and $G$ is edge-maximal with respect to $\mathcal{P}$, this implies that $q=1$, so $w_0,\ldots,w_q=w_0w_q$ consists of a single edge and $\{w_0,w_q\}\subseteq U$.

    We may now assume that $G$ is connected. For each $v\in V(G)$, let $r(v):=\max\{i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}:v\in B_i\}$.  Consider the \emph{greedy path} $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ that begins at $u_0\in B_{1}$, ends at $u_p\in B_{m}$, and is defined as follows: $u_0$ is a vertex in $B_{1}$ that maximizes $r(u_0)$.  For $i\ge 1$, $u_i$ is a vertex in $B_{r(u_{i-1})}$ that maximizes $r(u_i)$.  It is well known that $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is a shortest path from $B_{1}$ to $B_{m}$, i.e., $p=\min\{d_H(w_0,w_q): w_0\in B_1,\, w_q\in B_m\}$.  Therefore, if $p>\ell$, the lemma is again trivially satisified by taking $U:=B_{1}\cup B_{m}$.

    Otherwise, $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ defines a sequence $y_0,\ldots,y_p$ of nodes in $P$, where $y_0:=1$ and, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$, $y_{i}:=r(u_{i-1})$.  Consider a path decomposition $\mathcal{P'}:=(B'_x:x\in V(P))$  obtained by removing $u_i$ from $B_{j}$ for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,p\}$ and each $j\in\{y_i,\ldots,m\}$. Let $G'$ be the graph with $V(G'):=\bigcup_{x=1}^m B'_x$ that is edge-maximal with respect to $\mathcal{P}'$.  Observe that $\mathcal{P'}$ has width at most $t-1$.

    For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$, let $G'_i:=G'[\bigcup_{j=y_{i-1}}^{y_i}B'_j]$ and $\mathcal{P}'_i:=(B'_x:x\in\{y_{i-1},\ldots,y_i\})$.
    Note that $G'_i$ may contain $u_i$ (if $u_i\in B_{y_i-1}$) but $G'_i$ does not contain $u_{i-1}$ because $u_{i-1}$ does not appear in $B_j'$ for any $j\in\{y_{i-1},\ldots,m\}$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$, we apply the lemma inductively to $G'_i$ and $\mathcal{P}'_i$ to obtain a set $U'_i$ of size $O(\ell^{t-1})$ that satisfies the requirements of the lemma for the graph $G'_i$. Let $U:=\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}\cup\bigcup_{i=1}^p U'_i$.

    For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$, $U$ contains $u_{i-1}$ and $u_i$.
    The set $U_i'$ is obtained by induction on $G_i'$ using a path decomposition on a path whose endpoints are $y_{i-1}$ and $y_i$ having bags $B'_{y_{i-1}}=B_{y_{i-1}}\setminus u_{i-1}$ and $B'_{y_{i}}=B_{y_{i}}\setminus u_{i}$.  Therefore $U$ contains $\{u_{i-1},u_i\}\cup B'_{y_{i-1}}\cup B'_{y_i}=B_{y_{i-1}}\cup B_{y_i}$.

    In particular, $U$ contains $B_{y_0}=B_1$ and $B_{y_p}=B_m$, so $U$ satisfies (Z\ref{values-u}). The size of $U$ satisfies the recurrence $f(0)\le 2$ and $f(t)\le \ell+1+\ell\cdot f(t-1)$, which resolves to $f(t)\le (3\ell^{t+1}-\ell^t-\ell-1)/(\ell-1) \in O(\ell^t)$, so $U$ satisifes (Z\ref{size-u}).  All that remains is to show that $U$ satisfies (Z\ref{induced-u}).  Consider some induced path $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ in $G$ of length at most $\ell$ with $\{w_0,w_q\}\subseteq U$.  We want to show that $\{w_1,\ldots,w_{q-1}\}\subseteq U$.

    We say that a vertex $w_i$ is \emph{pinched} if $w_i\in B_{y_j}$ for some $j\in\{0,\ldots,p\}$. (Note that each of $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is pinched.) The edges of $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ can be partitioned into subpaths of the form $w_{a},\ldots,w_{b}$ where
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item $a=0$ or $w_a$ is pinched;
        \item $b=q$ or $w_b$ is pinched; and
        \item none of $w_{a+1},\ldots,w_{b-1}$ are pinched.
    \end{inparaenum}
    First note that, for any such subpath $w_a,\ldots,w_b$, $\{w_a,w_b\}\subseteq U$, so we need only show that $\{w_{a+1},\ldots,w_{b-1}\}\subseteq U$.  There are three cases to consider:

    \begin{compactenum}
       \item $\{w_a,w_b\}\subseteq B_{y_j}$ for some $j\in\{0,\ldots,p\}$.  Since $G$ is edge-maximal with respect to $\mathcal{P}$, this implies  $w_aw_b\in E(G)$. Since $w_a,\ldots,w_b$ is an induced path in $G$, $b=a+1$ and there is nothing to prove.

       \item $\{w_a,w_b\}\in V(G_j')$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$ (and not the preceding case). In this case, edge-maximality implies that $B_{y_{j-1}}$ and $B_{y_{j}}$ each form cliques that separate $G'_{j}$ from $G-V(G'_j)$.  Since $w_a,\ldots,w_b$ is an induced path in $G$, this implies that $\{w_a,\ldots,w_b\}\subseteq V(G_j')$.  Therefore, $w_a,\ldots,w_b$ is an induced path in $G_j'$ so, by the inductive hypothesis, $\{w_{a+1},\ldots,w_{b-1}\}\subseteq U_j'\subseteq U$.  (Note that this includes the special case in which $u_j\in\{w_a,\ldots,w_b\}$.)

       \item $w_a = u_j$ for some $j\in\{0,\ldots,p\}$ and $w_b\in V(G_{j+1}')$.  There are three subcases to consider:
       \begin{compactenum}
            \item $w_{a+1}\in B_{y_{j+1}}$.  In this case $b=a+1$ and there is nothing to prove.

            \item $w_{a+1}=w_q$. In this case $b=q=a+1$ and there is nothing to prove.

            \item Neither of the previous two cases. We argue that this is not possible, so the previous two cases are already exhaustive.  Since $w_{a+1}\not\in B_{y_{j+1}}$, $w_{a+1}\in V(G_{j+1}')\setminus B_{y_{j+1}}$. Since $w_{a+1}\neq w_q$, ${a+2}\le q$ and $w_{a+2}\in V(G_{j+1}')$.  However since $G$ is edge-maximal with respect to $\mathcal{P}$, $N_G(u_j)\supseteq V(G_{j+1}')$. In particular, $w_aw_{a+2}\in E(G)$, contradicting the assumption that $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ is an induced path in $G$. \qedhere
        \end{compactenum}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{proof}

A node $x$ in a rooted tree $T$ is a \emph{branching node} if $x$ has at least two children.  Let $\Lambda(T)$ denote the set of branching nodes in a tree $T$.  Let $H$ be a graph that is edge-maximal with respect to some tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of width at most $t$. We define the \emph{$(\mathcal{T},\ell)$-skeleton} $\hat{H}$ of $H$ as the induced subgraph of $H$ whose vertex set is defined as follows:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item $V(\hat{H})$ contains $\bigcup_{x\in\Lambda(T)} B_x$.

    \item For each pair of branching nodes $x,y\in\Lambda(T)$ such that the path $P_T(x,y)$ from $x$ to $y$ in $T$ has no branching node in its interior, $V(\hat{H})$ contains the set $U_{xy}\subseteq V(H)$ obtained by applying \cref{path-induced} to the graph $G_{xy}:=H[\bigcup_{z\in V(P_T(x,y))} B_z]$ with the path decomposition $\mathcal{P}_{xy}:=(B_z:z\in P_T(x,y))$.  (Note that $G_{xy}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{xy}$ satisfy the edge-maximality required for \cref{path-induced} since $H$ is edge-maximal with respect to $\mathcal{T}$.)
\end{compactenum}


\begin{lem}\label{skeleton-paths}
    Let $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ be an induced path in $H$ of length at most $\ell$ and with endpoints $\{w_0,w_q\}\subseteq V(\hat{H})$. Then $\{w_1,\ldots,w_{q-1}\}\subseteq V(\hat{H})$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Partition the edges of $w_0,\ldots,w_q$ into paths of the form $w_a,\ldots,w_b$ such that
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item $a=0$ or $w_a\in\bigcup_{x\in \Lambda(T)} B_x$;
        \item $b=q$ or $w_b\in\bigcup_{x\in \Lambda(T)} B_x$; and
        \item none of $w_{a+1},\ldots,w_{b-1}$ are contained $\bigcup_{x\in \Lambda(T)} B_x$.
    \end{inparaenum}
    This means that $w_a,\ldots,w_b$ is contained in $G_{xy}$ for some $x,y\in \Lambda(H)$.  Therefore $\{w_a,\ldots,w_b\}\subseteq U_{xy}\subseteq U$, as required.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{skeleton-size}
    $|V_t|\le |\Lambda(T)|\cdot O(\ell^t)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    This follows from \cref{path-induced} (Z\ref{size-u}) and the fact that there are $|\Lambda(T)|-1$ distinct pairs $x,y\in\Lambda(T)$ such that $P_T(x,y)$ has no internal nodes in $\Lambda(T)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{skeleton-colour}
    Let $H$ be a graph that is edge-maximal with respect to some width-$t$ tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ that defines a $(\mathcal{T},\ell)$-skeleton $\hat{H}$, of $H$.  Then $\lrn(H)\in O(\lrn(\hat{H}))$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\varphi:V(\hat{H})\to \{(\ell+1)t+2,\ldots,\lrn(\hat{H})+(\ell+1)t+1\}$ be an $\ell$-ranking of $\hat{H}$. The graph $P:=T-\Lambda(T)$ consists of disjoint paths and, for any edge $vw\in E(H-V(\hat{H})))$ there is a node $x\in V(P)$ such that $\{v,w\}\subseteq B_x$.  Therefore $(B_x:x\in V(P))$ is a width-$t$ path decomposition of $H-V(\hat{H})$, so $\pw(H-V(\hat{H}))\le t$.  Therefore, by \cref{pathwidth}, $H-V(\hat{H})$ has an $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(H-V(\hat{H}))\to\{1,\ldots,(\ell+1)t+1\}$.  This gives a colouring $\varphi: V(H)\to\{1,\ldots,\trn(\hat{H})+(\ell+1)t+1\}$.

    We claim that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $\hat{H}$.  To see this, consider some path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ with $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$.  We must show that $\varphi(u_i)>\varphi(u_0)$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$.
    By \cref{induced-paths-only}, we may assume that $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is an induced path. There are a few cases to consider:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\{u_0,u_p\}\subseteq V(H-V(\hat{H}))$. There are two subcases:
        \begin{compactenum}
            \item $\{u_1,\ldots,u_{r-1}\}\subseteq V(H-V(\hat{H}))$.  In this case, $u_0,\ldots,p_p$ is a path in $H-V(\hat{H})$, so  $\varphi(u_0)<\varphi(u_i)$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$ since \cref{pathwidth} ensures that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $H-V(\hat{H})$.

            \item $u_i\in V(\hat{H})$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$. In this case, $\varphi(u_0)\le (\ell+1)t+1 < (\ell+1)t+2 \le \varphi(u_i)$.
        \end{compactenum}
        \item $\{u_0,u_p\}\subseteq V(\hat{H})$.
        % In this case, \cref{induced-unimodal} implies that $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is $\mathcal{T}$-unimodal, i.e., $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is the concatenation of two paths, one upward and one downward.
        By \cref{skeleton-paths}  $\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}\subseteq V(\hat{H})$, so  $\varphi(u_0)<\varphi(u_i)$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$ since $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $\hat{H}$. \qedhere
    \end{compactenum}
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{The Meat}

Now we arrive at the combinatorial core of the proof. The main idea is break $H$ up into a sequence of blocks, each of which consists of $\ell+1$ consecutive BFS layers.  Each pair of consecutive blocks overlaps in a single BFS layer.  The following lemma is what allows us to handle the first block.  The purpose of the weighting $(n_v:v\in V(H))$ is to allow us to account for the fact that this first block has more layers attached to it.

\begin{lem}\label{t-tree-slack}
    Let $t,d,\ell,\beta\in\N$ be fixed values, let $k\in\N$ and $c\in\R$ be such that $t\ge 2$ and $\tau(t-1)\le c\le k$; let $H$ be a graph with $\diam(H)\le d$ and $\stw(H)\le t$ in which each vertex $v\in V(H)$ is assigned a real-valued weight $n_v\ge 1$. Then there exists a constant $a:=a(t,\ell,d,\beta)$ such that, if
    \begin{equation}
         \sum_{v\in V(H)} n_v \le \beta\cdot\frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} c)^{c}} \enspace ,
     \label{total-weight}
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation}
         \max\{n_v:v\in V(H)\} \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} (c+s))^{c+s}} \enspace ,
     \label{max-weight}
    \end{equation}
    where $s := \log c/\log^{(t-1)} c$,
    then $H$ has an $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(H)\to a(k-c-1)$ such that $\varphi(v)> a(k-\gamma_{t-2,k}(n_v)-1)$ for each $v\in V(H)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Without loss of generality, we may assume $H$ is edge-maximal with respect to some $r$-rooted $t$-simple tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$.  Let $L_0,\ldots,L_h$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=B_r$.  Note that $h\le\diam(H)\le d$.

    The proof is by induction on $|H|$.  In the base case, $|H|=0$ and there is nothing to prove. Now assume $|H|\ge 1$.  For each subgraph $X$ of $H$, define $n_{X}:=\sum_{v\in V(X)} n_v$ so that \cref{total-weight} implies that $n_H\le(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)}c)^c$.  For $v\in V(H)$ we use the shorthand $\gamma_v:=\gamma_{t-2,k}(n_v)$ and for any subgraph $X$ of $H$ we use the shorthand $\gamma_X := \gamma_{t-2,k}(n_X)$.  Note that \cref{total-weight,max-weight} imply that $\gamma_H \ge (\log c)^c$ and $\gamma_v\ge(\log(c+s))^{c+s}$ for each $v\in V(H)$.

    Let
    \begin{equation}
        n_0 := \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)}\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)\right)^{c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}}} \enspace . \label{heavy-def}
    \end{equation}
    We say that a subgraph $X$ of $H$ is \emph{heavy} if $n_X>n_0$ and $X$ is \emph{light} otherwise.  For a heavy subgraph $X$,
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{|H|}{n_X} < \frac{|H|}{n_0}
        \le \beta\cdot \frac{\left(\log^{(t-2)}\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)\right)^{c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}}}{(\log^{(t-2)} c)^c}
         \in O\left(c^4\right)
    \enspace ,
    \end{equation}
    where the upper bound of $O(c^4)$ is justified by a calculation given in \cref{calculation-i}.
    % since $c+s\in O(c)$.

    By \cref{weighted-separator} with the weight function $\xi(v):=n_v$, there exists $S_T\subseteq V(T)$ of size $O(c^4)$ that defines $S:=\bigcup_{x\in S_T} B_x$ such that each component $X$ of $H-S$ is light.  Let $T'$ be the subtree of $T$ induced by $S_T$ and every $T$-ancestor of every node in $S_T$, i.e., $T':=T[\bigcup_{x\in S_T} V(P_T(x))]$. Let $H':=H[\bigcup_{x\in V(T')} B_x]$.
    % Observe that $\mathcal{T'}:=(B_x:x\in V(T'))$ is a $t$-simple tree decomposition of $H'$, so $\stw(H')\le t$.

    For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,h\}$, let $H'_i:=H'[L_i]$.   $\mathcal{T}'_i:=(B_x\cap L_i: x\in V(T'))$ is a tree decomposition of $H'_i$ and $H'_i$ is edge-maximal with respect to $\mathcal{T}'_i$.  Each leaf $x$ of $T'$ is an element of $S_T$, therefore $T'$ has at most $|S_T|\in O(c^4)$ leaves. Since $T'$ has $O(c^4)$ leaves, it has $O(c^4)$ branching nodes.  Therefore, by \cref{skeleton-size}, the $(\mathcal{T}_i',\ell)$-skeleton $\hat{H}_i'$ of $H_i'$ has size $|\hat{H_i}'|\in O(c^4)$.  Since $\hat{H}'_i$ is a subgraph of $H'_i$, $\stw(\hat{H}'_i)\le\stw(H'_i)\le\stw(H[L_i])\le t-1$, where the last inequality follows from \cref{simple-bfs-layers}.


    By \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} applied to the graph $\hat{H}_i'$ (which has simple treewidth at most $t-1$),\footnote{The case $i=0$ is exception here, since $H[L_0]=H[B_r]$ is a clique of size at most $t+1$, which certainly has an $\ell$-ranking using at most $t+1\in O(1)$ colours.}
    \[
       \lrn(\hat{H_i}')\in
       O\left(\frac{\log|\hat{H_i}'|}{\log^{(t-1)}|\hat{H_i}'|}\right)
       \subseteq O\left(\frac{\log c^4}{\log^{(t-1)} c^4}\right)
       = O\left(\frac{\log c}{\log^{(t-1)} c}\right)
       = O(s) \enspace .
    \]
    Therefore, by \cref{skeleton-colour} $\lrn(H_i')\in O(s)$, so
    $H_i'$ has an $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(H_i')\to \{\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor-(i+1)q+1,\ldots,\lfloor a(k-c-1)\lfloor-iq\}$ for some $q\in O(s)$.

    In the preceding paragraphs, we have defined a colouring $\varphi: V(H')\to \{\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor-(h+1)q,\ldots,\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor\}$. For a sufficiently large constant $a:=a(t,\ell,d,\beta)$, $(h+1)q < as$, so $\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor-(h+1)q+1 > a(k-c-s-1)$. Therefore, each vertex in $H'$ receives a colour larger than $a(k-c-s-1)$. By \cref{max-weight}, $\gamma_v\ge c+s$ for each $v\in V(H)$, so $\varphi(v)> a(k-c-s-1) \ge a(k-\gamma_v-1)$ for each $v\in V(H')$, as required.

    Since $S':=V(H')\supseteq S$, each component $X$ of $H-V(H')$ is light, so
    \[
       n_{X} \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{
        \left(
            \log^{(t-2)}
                \left(
                   c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}
               \right)
        \right)^{\left(
           c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}
       \right)}
       }
   \]
   Therefore, we can apply \cref{t-tree-slack} inductively on each component $X$ of $H-S'$ since $|X|<|H|$ and $X$ satisfies \cref{total-weight} with the value $c'=c+s$ and \cref{max-weight} with the value $s'=\log c'/\log^{(t-1)} c'$.\footnote{Indeed, $\sum_{v\in V(X)} n_x\le n_0$, so $\max\{n_v:v\in V(X)\}\le n_0= (\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)}(c'+s'))^{c'+s'}$.}  This gives an $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(X)\to\{1,\ldots,a(k-c'-1)\}$ in which $\varphi(v)> a(k-\gamma_v-1)$ for each $v\in V(X)$, as required.
   Doing this for each component $X$ of $H-S'$ completes the colouring $\varphi$ to a total colouring of $H$.

   All that remains is to verify that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $H$. To do this, consider any path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $H$ with $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$.  By \cref{induced-paths-only} we may assume that $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ is an induced path in $H$.  We must show that $\varphi(u_0)<\varphi(u_j)$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$. There are a few cases to consider:
   \begin{compactenum}
        \item If $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p) > a(k-c'-1)$ then $\{u_0,u_p\}\subseteq V(H')$.  By \cref{induced-unimodal}, $x_T(u_i)$ is a $\mathcal{T}$-ancestor of at least one of $x_T(u_0)$ or $x_T(u_p)$ for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,p\}$.  By construction, $T'$ contains every $T$-ancestor of $x_T(u_0)$ and $T'$ contains every $T$-ancestor of $x_T(u_p)$.  Therefore $\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}\subseteq \bigcup_{x\in V(T')} B_x=V(H')$.

        For distinct $i$ and $j$ vertices in $H'_i$ and $H'_j$ receive colours from disjoint sets.  Therefore, since $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$,  $\{u_0,u_p\}\subseteq V(H'_i)$ for some $i\in\{0,\ldots,h\}$.  By \cref{order-relation,induced-unimodal}, $\{u_0,\ldots,u_{r}\}\subseteq \bigcup_{j=0}^{i} V(H'_j)$.  There are two cases to consider:
        \begin{compactenum}
           \item $\{u_0,\ldots,u_{r}\}\subseteq V(H'_i)$ in which case $\varphi(u_j)>\varphi(u_0)$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$ since $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $H'_i$ (by the application of \cref{skeleton-colour} to $H'_i$); or
           \item $u_j\in V(H'_{i-1})$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$.  In this case $\varphi(u_j)>\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor-iq + 1 > \lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor-iq \ge \varphi(u_0)$.
       \end{compactenum}
       \item If $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p) \le a(k-c'-1)$ then $u_0\in V(X)$ and $u_p\in V(Y)$ for some components $X$ and $Y$ of $H-S'$.  Either
       \begin{compactenum}
            \item $u_j\in S'=V(H')$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$ in which case $\varphi(u_j)>a(k-c'-1)\ge\varphi(u_0)$; or
            \item $X=Y$ and $\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}\subseteq V(X)$, in which case $\varphi(u_j)>\varphi(u_0)$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,p\}$ (by the application of \cref{t-tree-slack}, inductively, on $X$). \qedhere
        \end{compactenum}
    \end{compactenum}
\end{proof}

Since our strategy is to use \cref{t-tree-slack} on the first $\ell+1$ BFS layers of $H$ and then recurse on the subgraphs attached to layer $\ell+1$, we need to define vertex weights $n_v$ that allow us to capture the sizes of the subgraphs attached to vertices in layer $\ell+1$.  The following lemma shows that the obvious approach to this does not overcount by more than a factor of $t$.

\begin{lem}\label{size-claim}
    Let $H$ be a graph that is edge-maximal with respect to an $r$-rooted tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of width at most $t$ and let $\mathcal{L}:=L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0=B_r$.  For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,m\}$ and each $v\in L_i$, let $H_v$ be the component of $H[\{v\}\bigcup_{j=i+1}^m L_j]$ that contains $v$ and let $\kappa_v:= t-1+|H_v|$.  Then $\sum_{v\in L_i} \kappa_v \le t\cdot|H|$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    For each component $X$ of $H[\bigcup_{j=i+1}^m L_j]$, let $C_X:=L_i\cap N_H(V(X))$.  By \cref{up-neighbours}, $|C_X|\le t$. A vertex $w\in V(X)$ appears in $H_v$ if and only if $v\in C_X$.  Therefore,
    \[
        \sum_{v\in L_i} \kappa_v \le t\cdot|L_i| + \sum_{X}|C_X|\cdot|X| \le t\cdot|L_i| + \sum_{X}t\cdot|X|\le t\cdot|H| \enspace .  \qedhere
    \]
\end{proof}

Finally, we can prove the technical lemma that implies \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}.

\begin{lem}\label{t-tree-technical}
    Let $n,k,t,\ell\in\N$ and $c\in\R$ be such that $n\le (\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} c)^{c}$;let $H$ be an $n$-vertex graph that is edge-maximal with respect to some $r$-rooted $t$-simple tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$; and let $B_r:=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{t'}\}$; and let $L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=B_r$.

    Then, there exists an integer $a:=a(t,\ell)$ such that, for any distinct $\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_{t'}\in \{\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor+1,\ldots,ak\}$ there exists an $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ such that
    \begin{compactenum}[(R1)]
        \item $\varphi(v_i)=\phi_i$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,t'\}$; and
        \item $\varphi(v)<a(k-c-1)$ for each $v\in\bigcup_{j=1}^{\ell} L_i$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $n$. If $n=0$, then there is nothing to prove.

    Let $n_0:=(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} (c+s))^{c+s}$ and, for each $v\in V(H)$, let $\kappa_v$ be defined as in \cref{size-claim}.  We say that a vertex $v\in L_{\ell+1}$ is \emph{dangerous} if $\kappa(v)>n_0$ and $v$ is \emph{harmless} otherwise.

    We now assign weights to the vertices of the graph $H_0:=H[\bigcup_{j=0}^{\ell+1}]$ in such a way that we can apply \cref{t-tree-slack} to $H_0$.  For each $v\in\bigcup_{j=0}^\ell L_j$, we set $n_v:=1$.  For each $v\in L_{\ell+1}$, we set $n_v := \min\{n_0, \kappa_v\}$.  With this assignment of weights, \cref{size-claim} implies that $\sum_{v\in V(H_0)} n_v\le tn$, which satisifies \cref{total-weight} with $\beta=t$ and, by definition, $\max\{n_v:v\in V(H_0)\}\le n_0$ which satisfies \cref{max-weight}.

    Again, we use the shorthand $\gamma_v := \gamma_{t-2,k}(n_v)$.    Therefore, by \cref{t-tree-slack}, $H_{0}$ has an $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(H_0)\to\{1,\ldots,\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor\}$ in which $\varphi(v)> a(k-\gamma_v-1)$ for each $v\in V(H_0)$.
    By \cref{size-claim}, the number of dangerous vertices is at most
    \[
        \frac{tn}{n_0} \in O\left(\frac{(\log^{(t-2)} (c+s))^{c+s}}{(\log^{(t-2)} c)^c}\right) \in O(c) \enspace ,
    \]
    where the $O(c)$ upper bound is justified by a calculation in \cref{calculation-ii}.
    Before continuing, we make the following modifications to $\varphi$.

    \begin{compactenum}
        \item We set $\varphi(v_i):=\phi_i$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,t'\}$.
        \item For each dangerous vertex $v$, we set $\varphi(v)$ to a distinct value in $\{\lfloor a(k-c-1)\rfloor+1,\ldots,ak\}\setminus\{\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_t\}$. (Since the number of dangerous vertices is $O(c)$, this is always possible.)
    \end{compactenum}
    These modifications ensure that $\varphi$ satisfies requirements (R1) and (R2) and, since they only introduce new unique colours larger than any existing colour, they preserve the fact that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $H_0$.

    For each component $X$ of $H-H_0$, let $C_X:=L_{\ell+1}\cap N_H(V(X))$ and let $H_X:=H[C_X\cup V(X)]$.  By \cref{up-neighbours}, $|C_X|\le t$. We apply induction on $H_X$ for each component $X$ of $H-H_0$ using colours $\phi_1',\ldots,\phi_{t'}'$ already assigned to the vertices in $C_X$.
    When we do this, we obtain an $\ell$-ranking of $H_X$ in which each vertex $w$ of $X[\bigcup_{j=\ell+2}^{2\ell+1} L_j]$ receives a colour $\varphi(w) \le a(k-\gamma_{t-2,k}(|H_X|)-1)$.

    For each harmless vertex $v\in C_X$, $X$ is a subgraph of $H_v$, so $n_v\ge t+|X|\ge |C_X|+|X|= |H_X|$, so $\gamma_v \le \gamma_{t-2,k}(|H_X|)$. Therefore, for each harmless $v\in C_X$, $\varphi(v)> a(k-\gamma_v-1)\ge\varphi(w)$ for each $w\in V(X)\cap [\bigcup_{j=\ell+2}^{2\ell+1} L_j]$.  For each dangerous vertex $v\in C_X$, $\varphi(v)>a(k-c-1)$.  Since $|H_X|\le|H|$, $\gamma_{t-2,k}(|H_X|) \ge c$.  Therefore each dangerous vertex $v\in C_X$ also receives a colour larger than each vertex $w$ in $X[\bigcup_{j=\ell+2}^{2\ell+1} L_j]$.

    All that remains is to verify that the resulting colouring is, indeed, an $\ell$-ranking of $H$.  Consider some induced path $u_0,\ldots,u_p$ in $H$ of length $r\le\ell$ such that $\varphi(u_0)=\varphi(u_p)$.  There are some cases to consider:

    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $\{u_0,u_p\}\subseteq V(H_0)$. In this case, \cref{order-relation,induced-unimodal} imply that $\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}\subseteq V(H_0)$.  However, we have already established that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $H_0$ through the application of \cref{t-tree-slack} and the subsequent recolouring of vertices in $L_0$ and $L_{\ell+1}$.  Therefore, $\varphi(u_0)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$.

        \item $u_0\in V(X)$ for some component $X$ of $H-H_0$ and $u_i\in C_X$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,p-1\}$.  Since $i<p\le\ell$, this implies that $u_0\in\bigcup_{j=\ell+2}^{\ell+p+1} L_j\subseteq \bigcup_{j=\ell+2}^{2\ell+1}L_j$.  We have already argued above that this implies that $\varphi(u_i)>\varphi(u_0)$.

        \item $\{u_0,\ldots,u_p\}\subseteq V(X)$ for some component $X$ of $H-H_0$.  In this case, the inductive hypothesis ensures that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-ranking of $X$, so $\varphi(u_0)<\max\{\varphi(u_0),\ldots,\varphi(u_p)\}$. \qedhere
    \end{compactenum}
\end{proof}

Rewriting \cref{t-tree-technical} in terms of $n$ yields \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}:

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{simple-t-trees} (upper bound)]
    By \cref{t-tree-technical}, $\lrn(H)\in O(k)$ for any $k$ that satisfies
    \[  (\log^{(t-2)} k)^{k} \ge n \Leftrightarrow
        k \ge \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t-1)} k}
    \]
    Taking $k=2\log n/\log^{(t)} n$, this becomes
    \[
        \frac{2\log n}{\log^{(t)} n}
        \ge \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t-1)}(\log n + 2 -\log^{(t)} n)}
        = \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t)} n - O(1/\log n)}
        = \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t)} n}+O(1) \enspace .
    \]
    which is clearly true for all sufficiently large $n$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Bounded Genus Graphs}

We now prove the upper bound in \cref{bounded-genus}. A graph $G$ is an \emph{apex} graph if there exists an \emph{apex vertex} $v\in V(G)$ such that $G-\{v\}$ is planar. We make use of the following product structure theorem of \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}:\footnote{\citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar} state a version of \cref{product-structure} that describes $H$ as an apex graph of treewidth at most $4$.  By definition, this means that $H$ has an \emph{apex} vertex $v_0$ such that $H-\{v_0\}$ is planar.  In fact, in their proof, $v_0$ is a dominating vertex.  Because of this, the removal of $v_0$ also reduces the simple treewidth of $H$ to 3, yielding the version of \cref{product-structure-genus} stated here.}

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}] \label{product-structure-genus}
    For every $n$-vertex graph $G$ of Euler genus at most $g$, there exists some at most $n$-vertex path $P$, some at most $n$-vertex graph $H$, and a vertex $v_0\in V(H)$ such that $\stw(H-\{v_0\})\le 3$ and $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_{\max\{2g,3\}}\boxtimes P$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{bounded-genus}]
    Apply \cref{product-structure-genus} to $G$ to obtain the graph $H$, path $P$, and apex vertex $v_0\in V(H)$.  By \cref{planar} there exists a $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(H-\{v_0\})\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$ with $k\in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$. Setting $\varphi(v_0):=k+1$ then gives an $\ell$-ranking of $H$, so $\lrn(H)\le k+1\in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$.  The same argument used to show that $\dlcn(K_3\boxtimes P)\le 3(\ell+1)$ (\cref{dumb}) shows that $\dtcn(K_{\max\{2g,3\}}\boxtimes P)\le \max\{2g+3\}\cdot(\ell+1)$.  \cref{bounded-genus} now follows from \cref{product-lemma}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Other Graph Families with Product Structure}

As noted in the introduction, several other families of graphs are known to have product structure theorems like \cref{product-structure,product-structure-genus}.  In particular, \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar} show:

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}]\label{apex-minor-free}
    For any apex graph $A$, there exists a value $t$ such that any $n$-vertex $A$-minor free graph $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$ where $|H|\le n$, $\tw(H)\le t$, and $P$ is a path.
\end{thm}

\citet{dujmovic.morin.ea:structure} show a similar result for some non-minor-closed families of graphs, the most well-known of which are the $k$-planar graphs:

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.morin.ea:structure}]\label{gk-planar}
    For any integers $g$ and $k$, there exists a value $t$ such that any $n$-vertex $(g,k)$-planar graph $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$, where $|H|\le n$, $\tw(H)\le t$, and $P$ is a path.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{meta}]
    For any $n$-vertex member $G$ of these graph families, \cref{gk-planar,apex-minor-free} show that $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$ with $\tw(H)\le t$.  \Cref{product-lemma,t-trees} and the fact that $\lrn(P)\le \ell+1$ then imply \cref{meta}.
\end{proof}

%========================================================================
\section{Discussion}
\label{conclusion}

We have given asymptotically optimal bounds on the number of colours required by $\ell$-rankings of $n$-vertex graphs of treewidth $t$, graphs of simple treewidth $t$, planar 3-trees, outerplanar graphs, and planar graphs.  Prior to this work, the best known bounds for planar graphs were $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$ (trees) and $O(\log n)$.

Our upper bounds are constructive and lead to straightforward $O(n)$ time algorithms for finding $\ell$-rankings of (simple) treewidth $t$ graphs, including planar 3-trees, and outerplanar graphs.  For planar graphs, we require an algorithmic version of \cref{product-structure}. Currently, the fastest such algorithm runs in $O(n\log n)$ time \cite{morin:fast}.

% Two directions for future work stand out:
% \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    % \item This work has deliberately ignored constants that depend on $\ell$ and $t$.  In the current proof, the hidden constant in the big-Oh notation is at least $\Omega(\ell^t)$; see \cref{path-induced}.  Can this be improved?
For constant $d$, the lower and upper bounds for 2-ranking $d$-degenerate graphs are $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$, respectively.  Closing this gap is an intriguing open problem.
% \end{inparaenum}
