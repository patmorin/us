\begin{abstract}
  A (vertex) 2-ranking is a labelling $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of the vertices of a graph $G$ with integer colours so that for any path $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ of length $r\le 2$, $\max\{\varphi(v_0),\ldots,\varphi(v_r)\}$ appears exactly once in the sequence $\varphi(v_0),\ldots,\varphi(v_r)$.  We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph has a 2-ranking using $O(\log n/\log\log\log n)$ colours and this is tight; for some $n$-vertex planar graphs, any 2-ranking requires $\Omega(\log n/\log\log\log n)$ colours.  This result also extends to bounded genus graphs.

  In developing this proof we obtain optimal bounds on the number of colours needed for 2-ranking $t$-trees and simple $t$-trees (this includes planar 3-trees and outerplanar graphs).  These upper bounds are constructive and give $O(n\log n)$-time algorithms.  Additional results that come from our techniques include new sublogarithmic upper bounds on the number of colours needed for 2-rankings of bounded genus graphs, apex minor-free graphs, and $k$-planar graphs.

\section{Introduction}

A sequence of integers $\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_r$ is \emph{ranked} if $\max\{\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_r\}$ occurs exactly once in $\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_r$. A \emph{colouring} $\varphi:V(G)\to \N$ of a graph $G$ is an \emph{$\ell$-ranking} if, for every path $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ in $G$ of length\footnote{The length of a path $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ is the number, $r$, of edges in the path.} at most $\ell$ the sequence $\varphi(v_0),\ldots,\varphi(v_r)$ is ranked.\footnote{An alternative, but equivalent, condition is that for every path $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ of length $r\le\ell$,
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
   \item $\varphi(v_0)\neq \varphi(v_r)$; or
   \item $\max\{\varphi(v_0),\ldots,\varphi(v_r)\} > \varphi(v_0)$.
\end{inparaenum}
}
The $\ell$-ranking number $\chi_\ell(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(G)\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$.  Note that, for any $\ell\ge 1$ any $\ell$-ranking of $G$ is a proper colouring\footnote{A colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to \N$ is \emph{proper} if, for each edge $vw\in E(G)$, $\varphi(v)\neq\varphi(w)$ and the \emph{chromatic number}, $\chi(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that there exists a proper colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$ of $G$.} of $G$, so $\chi(G)\le \chi_\ell(G)$, and any proper colouring of $G$ is a 1-ranking of $G$, so $\chi(G)=\chi_1(G)$.

Besides the case $\ell=1$, two cases have received special attention: An $\infty$-ranking is called a \emph{vertex ranking} or \emph{ordered colouring}. The parameter $\chi_\infty(G)$ is called the \emph{vertex ranking number} of $G$ and has applications to matrix factorization \cite{bodlaender.gilbert.ea:approximating,duff.reid:multifrontal,liu:role,dereniowski.kubale:cholesky}, VLSI layout \cite{leiserson:area,sen.deng.ea:on}, and the analysis of online algorithms \cite{even.smorodinsky:hitting}. The case $\ell=2$ has also received special attention \cite{almeter.demircan.ea:graph,karpas.neiman.ea:on,shalu.antony:complexity}. A $2$-ranking is called a \emph{unique-superior colouring} (abbreviated \emph{us-colouring}) by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} who prove the following result:

\setcounter{othertheorem}{19}
\begin{othertheorem}[\cite{karpas.neiman.ea:on}]\label{trees}
    For every $n$-vertex tree $T$, $\trn(T)\in O(\log n/\log\log n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex tree $T$ with $\trn(T)\in\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$.
\end{othertheorem}

The same authors prove the following result for planar graphs:

\setcounter{othertheorem}{15}
\begin{othertheorem}[\cite{karpas.neiman.ea:on}]\label{planar-graphs}
    For every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, $\trn(G)\in O(\log n)$.
\end{othertheorem}

Since every tree is a planar graph and no better lower bound is known for planar graphs, this leaves an obvious question:  Which is the correct bound for planar graphs, $\log n$ or $\log n/\log\log n$?  As it turns out, neither is correct.  Let $\log x :=\ln x$ denote the natural logarithm of $x$ and define $\log^{(0)}x:=x$ and, for any integer $i>0$, let $\log^{(i)}x:=\log(\log^{(i-1)} x)$. We prove:


\begin{thm}\label{planar}
    For every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, $\trn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ with $\trn(G)\in \Omega(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$
\end{thm}

Our proof of the upper bound in \cref{planar} makes use of a recent \emph{product structure theorem} of \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar} which states that every planar graph $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P$ where $H$ is a planar $3$-tree, $K_3$ is a 3-cycle, $P$ is a path, and $\boxtimes$ denotes the strong graph product.\footnote{Definitions of $t$-trees, simple $t$-trees, treewidth, simple treewidth, and strong graph product appear later, in \cref{sec:basics}.}  To apply this theorem, we prove the following result:

\begin{thm}\label{simple-t-trees}
    For every $n$-vertex simple $t$-tree $H$, $\trn(H) \in O(\log n/\log^{(t)}n)$.
    and this is asymptotically optimal: for all integer $t\ge 1$ and infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex simple $t$-tree $H$ with $\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(t)} n)$.
\end{thm}

\Cref{simple-t-trees} is immediately relevant because a 3-tree is planar if and only if it is a simple $3$-tree. Therefore, the lower bound in \cref{simple-t-trees} immediately implies the lower bound in \cref{planar} since it shows the existence of $n$-vertex planar graphs with $\trn(T)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$.

To obtain the upper bound in \cref{planar}, we apply \cref{simple-t-trees} to the graph $H$ defined by the product structure theorem along with a simple lemma which shows that, for any two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, $\trn(G_1\boxtimes G_2)\le \trn(G_1)\cdot\dtcn(G_2)$ where $\dtcn(G_2)$ is the \emph{distance-2 colouring number} of $G_2$;  the minimum number of colours needed to colour $G_2$ so that the endpoints of each non-trivial path of length at most 2 have different colours.  It is easy to see that $\dtcn(K_3\times P)\le 9$, so $\trn(H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P)\le 9\trn(H)$.

Every (not-necessarily simple) $t$-tree is the subgraph of some simple $(t+1)$-tree. Therefore, the upper bound in \cref{simple-t-trees} implies the (upper bound in) the following generalization of \cref{trees}:

\begin{thm}\label{t-trees}
    For every fixed $t$ and every $n$-vertex $t$-tree $H$, $\trn(H) \in O(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$ and this is asymptotically optimal: for infinitely many values of $n$, there exists an $n$-vertex $t$-tree $H$ with $\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$.
\end{thm}

The lower bound in \cref{t-trees} is through a construction of a $t$-tree $H$ with
$\trn(H)\in\Omega(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$.  Again, since every $(t-1)$-tree is the subgraph of a simple $t$-tree, the lower bound in \cref{t-trees} implies the lower bound in \cref{simple-t-trees}.

In addition to planar graphs, there are product structure theorems for a number of other graph classes, including bounded genus graphs, apex minor-free graphs, and $k$-planar graphs.  Using product structure theorems for these graph classes along with \cref{simple-t-trees,t-trees}, we obtain the following two results:

\begin{thm}\label{bounded-genus}
    For every $n$-vertex graph $G$ of Euler genus at most $g$, $\trn(G)\in O(g\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}\label{meta-theorem}\label{meta}
    For each of the following graph classes $\mathcal{G}$:
    \begin{compactenum}
        % \item the class of graphs that have non-crossing drawings in a surface of genus at most $g$;
        \item the class of graphs excluding a particular apex graph $A$ as a minor;
        \item the class of graphs that can be drawn in a surface of genus $g$ with at most $k$ crossings per edge,
    \end{compactenum}
    there exists an integer $c=c(\mathcal{G})$ such that, for every $n$-vertex graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$, $\trn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(c)} n)$.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Related Work}

For a graph $G$, a vertex $\infty$-ranking is known as a \emph{vertex ranking} \cite{bodlaender.deogun.ea:rankings} or \emph{ordered colouring} of $G$ \cite{katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered}.  Finding a vertex ranking $\varphi$ that uses exactly $\chi_\infty(G)$ colours is equivalent to finding a minimum-height elimination tree of $G$ \cite{torre.greenlaw.ea:optimal,deogun.kloks.ea:on}.  This measure has applications to parallel Cholesky factorization of matrices \cite{bodlaender.gilbert.ea:approximating,duff.reid:multifrontal,liu:role,dereniowski.kubale:cholesky} and in VLSI layout \cite{leiserson:area,sen.deng.ea:on}.  More recently, \citet{even.smorodinsky:hitting} showed that $\chi_\infty(G)$ determines the competitive ratio of the best algorithm for the online hitting set problem in $G$.

The \emph{vertex ranking problem} of determining $\chi_\infty(G)$ for an arbitrary graph $G$ is known to be NP-hard, even on some restricted classes of graphs \cite{bodlaender.deogun.ea:rankings,llewellyn.tovey.ea:local,llewellyn.tovey.ea:erratum,dereniowski.nadolski:vertex}. Polynomial-time algorithms for the vertex ranking problem have been found for several families of graphs: \citet{schaeffer:optimal} showed this for trees and \citet{deogun.kloks.ea:on} showed this for permutation graphs.

A straightforward application of divide-and-conquer using planar separators shows that, for any $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, $\chi_\infty(G) \in O(\sqrt{n})$ \cite{llewellyn.tovey.ea:local,katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered}, and this bound is optimal:  There exists $n$-vertex planar graphs $G$ with $\chi_\infty(G)\in \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ \cite{katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered}.  A lower bound of \citet{katchalski.mccuaig.ea:ordered} shows that upper bounds like this, using divide-and-conquer with separators, are essentially tight: If, for every $r$-element set $S\subseteq V(G)$, the graph $G-S$ has a component of size at least $\alpha m$, then $\chi_\infty(G) \in\Omega(\alpha r)$. In a similar vein, \citet{bodlaender.gilbert.ea:approximating,kloks:treewidth} show that $\chi_\infty(G)$ is lower bounded by 1 plus the pathwidth of $G$.

It is not hard to see that, even for an $n$-vertex path $P$, $\chi_\infty(P)\in\Omega(\log n)$.  The same separator argument, applied to treewidth-$t$ graphs shows that every $n$-vertex treewidth-$t$ graph $G$ has $\chi_\infty(G)\in O(t\log n)$.  This shows that, even for graphs with constant-size separators, (worst-case asymptotically) optimal bounds are obtained by divide-and-conquer using separators.  More references on graph rankings are available in Section 7.19 of the dynamic survey by \citet{gallian:dynamic}.

    \caption{Summary of previous and new results on $\trn$.}
\label{summary-table}
\end{table}

At least three works have considered $\chi_\ell$ for finite $\ell$ with a focus on the case $\ell=2$.  These results are summarized in \cref{summary-table}.  Note that 2-rankings fall between two very well-studied graph parameters:
\begin{compactitem}
    \item \emph{star colourings}, which ensure that the graph induced by an 2 colour classes is forest of stars and
    \item \emph{distance-2 colourings} which ensure that the endpoints each non-trivial path of length at most 2 receive distinct colours.
\end{compactitem}
Every 2-ranking is a star colouring and every distance-2 colouring is a 2-ranking so, letting $\scn(G)$ and $\dtcn(G)$ denote the star colouring number of $G$ and distance-2 colouring number of $G$, respectively, we have $\scn(G) \le \trn(G)\le \dtcn(G)$.

\citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} proved \cref{trees}---a tight bound of $\trn(T)\in O(\log n/\log\log n)$ for every $n$-vertex tree $T$---and \cref{planar-graphs}---the upper bound $\trn(G)\in O(\log n)$ for every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$.  More generally, the same authors show that, for any proper minor-closed family $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs and, for every positive integer $\ell$, $\chi_\ell(G)\in O(\ell\log n)$ for every $n$-vertex $G\in\mathcal{G}$.  They also show that, for fixed $d$, every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ has $\trn(G)\in O(\sqrt{n})$ and there exists examples with $\trn(G)\in\Omega(n^{1/3})$.

\citet{shalu.antony:complexity} show that determining the minimum number of colours required by a 2-ranking of a given graph is NP-hard, even when restricted to planar bipartite graphs.  \citet{almeter.demircan.ea:graph} determine the exact value of $\trn(Q_d)=d+1$ where $Q_d$ is the $d$-cube.  They also shows that, for graphs $G$ of maximum degree 3, $\trn(G)\le 7$ and show the existence of a graph with maximum degree $k$ such that $\trn(G)\in\Omega(k^2/\log k)$.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \Cref{sec:basics} reviews some basic tools used in the following sections.   \Cref{lower-bounds} proves the lower bound in \cref{t-trees}, which immediately implies the lower bounds in \cref{planar,simple-t-trees}. \Cref{upper-bounds} proves the upper bounds in \cref{planar,t-trees,simple-t-trees,bounded-genus}.  \Cref{conclusion} gives a brief summary and conclusions.

\section{Preliminaries}
\seclabel{basics}

In this paper we use standard graph theory terminology as used in the book by \citet{diestel:graph}
Every graph $G$ we consider is finite, simple, and undirected with vertex set denoted $V(G)$ and edge set denoted $E(G)$.  We use the shorthand $|G|:=|V(G)|$ to denote the number of vertices in $G$.  We use $N_G(v):=\{w\in V(G): vw\in E(G)\}$ to denote the open neighbourhood of $v$ in $G$.  For any set $S$, the induced subgraph  $G[S]$ is a graph with $V(G[S]):=V(G)\cap S$ and $E(G[S]):=\{vw\in E(G): \{v,w\}\subseteq S\}$, and $G-S:=G[V(G)\setminus S]$. For each $n\in\N$, $K_n$ denotes the complete graph on $n$ vertices.

The \emph{length} of a path $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ in a graph is equal to the number, $r$, of edges in the path. A path is \emph{trivial} if it has length 0 and \emph{non-trivial} otherwise.

Let $T$ be a rooted tree rooted at some node $r\in V(T)$.  For any node $x\in V(T)$, let $P_T(x)$ denote the path, in $T$, from $r$ to $x$.  The \emph{$T$-depth} of $x\in V(T)$, denoted $d_T(x)$ is the length of the path $P_T(x)$.  A node $a\in V(T)$ is a \emph{$T$-ancestor} of $x\in V(T)$ if $a\in V(P_T(x))$. If $a$ is a $T$-ancestor of $x$ then $x$ is a \emph{$T$-descendant} of $a$.  Note that every node of $T$ is both a $T$-ancestor and $T$-descendant of itself.  If $a$ is a $T$-ancestor of $x$ and $x\neq a$ then $a$ is a \emph{strict} $T$-ancestor of $x$ and $x$ is a \emph{strict} $T$-descedant of $x$.  The strict ancestor relation induces a partial order $\prec_T$ on $V(T)$ in which $x\prec_T y$ if and only if $x$ is a strict $T$-ancestor of $y$.

For any graph $H$, and any two vertices $v,w\in V(H)$, let $d_H(v,w)$ denote the length of the shortest path, in $H$, from $v$ to $w$. For any integer $k\ge 0$, the \emph{$k$-th power} of $H$, denote $H^k$ is the graph with vertex set $V(H^k):=V(H)$ and edge set $E(H^{k}):=\{vw:v,w\in V(H),\,d_H(v,w)\le k\}$. In the special case $k=2$, $H^2$ is called the \emph{square} of $H$.  Note that any distance-2 colouring $H$ is is a proper colouring of $H^2$ and vice-versa, $\dtcn(H)=\chi(H^2)$.

For any $v\in V(H)$ and any $W\subseteq V(H)$, let $d_H(v,W)=\min\{d_H(v,w):w\in W\}$. A \emph{BFS layering} of $H$ is a partition of $V(H)$ into a sequence $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ of sets such that, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ and each $v\in L_i$, $d_H(v,L_0)=i$.  Any BFS layering $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ defines a partial order $\prec_{\mathcal{L}}$ on $V(H)$ in which $v\prec_{\mathcal{L}} w$ if and only if $v\in L_i$, $w\in L_j$ and $i<j$.


\subsection{Treewidth}

A graph $H$ is a \emph{$t$-tree} if $H$ is a clique of size at most $t$ or if it contains a vertex $v$ such that $H[N_H(v)]$ is a $t$-clique and $H-\{t\}$ is a $t$-tree.  A \emph{$t$-forest} is a graph whose connected components are $t$-trees.

The recursive definition of $t$-trees implies that there is a permutation $\mathcal{R}:=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ of $V(H)$ such that, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, $H[N_H(v_i)\cap \{v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1}\}]$ is a clique of size $\min\{t,i-1\}$.  We call $\mathcal{R}$ a \emph{construction order} for $H$.  A construction order $\mathcal{R}$ induces a total order on $H$ that we denote by $<_{\mathcal{R}}$.

When a construction order $\mathcal{R}:=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ of $H$ is given, we call $C_{v_i}:=N_H(v_i)\cap \{v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1}\}$ the \emph{parent clique} of $v_i$ (with respect to the order $v_1,\ldots,v_n$).  The \emph{dominant parent} of $v_i$ (w.r.t. $v_1,\ldots,v_n$) is the vertex $v_j\in C_{v_i}$ that minimizes $j$. Note that the parent clique and dominant parent of any vertex $v_i$, is determined by the choice of the \emph{root clique} $v_1,\ldots,v_{t}$.

For two graphs $H$ and $X$, an \emph{$X$-decomposition} of $H$ is a sequence $\mathcal{X}:=(B_x:x\in V(X))$ of subsets of $V(H)$ called \emph{bags} indexed by the nodes of $X$ and such that
 \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
     \item for each $v\in V(H)$, $X[\{x\in V(X):v\in B_x\}]$ is connected; and
     \item for each $vw\in E(H)$, there exists some $x\in V(X)$ such that $\{v,w\}\subseteq B_x$.
\end{inparaenum}
The \emph{width} of $\mathcal{X}$ is $\max\{|B_x|:x\in V(X)\}-1$.

In the special case where $X$ is a tree (or a forest), $\mathcal{X}$ is called a \emph{tree decomposition} of $H$.  In the still more special case where $X$ is a path (or a collection of disjoint paths), $\mathcal{X}$ is called a \emph{path decomposition} of $H$. The \emph{treewidth} $\tw(H)$ of $H$ is the minimum width of any tree decomposition of $H$. The \emph{pathwidth} $\pw(H)$ of $H$ is the minimum width of any path decomposition of $H$.

It is not difficult to see that every $t$-tree $H$ has treewidth $t$ and a tree-decomposition of $H$ can be constructed incrementally from a construction order $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ of $H$: Start with a tree $T$ that consists of a single node $r$ with bag $B_r:=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{\min\{t+1,n\}}\}$ and, for $i\gets t+2,\ldots,n$, let $p_i$ be the minimum-depth node of $T$ such that $B_{p_i}$ contains the parent clique $N_H(v_i)\cap\{v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1}\}$ of $v_i$, and add a new leaf $x_i$ to $T$ adjacent to $p_i$ whose bag $B_{x_i}$ contains $v_i$ and its parent clique.  We call a tree-decomposition constructed this way a \emph{canonical} tree decomposition of $H$ generated by the construction order $v_1,\ldots,v_n$.

By construction, every bag of a canonical tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of a $t$-tree $H$ has size exactly $\min\{t+1,|H|\}$, $T$ is rooted at $r$ and, for each node $x$ of $T$ with parent $p$, $|B_x\setminus B_p|=1$.
% Note that this implies that $|V(T)|=\max\{1,n-t\}$.
% , since $B_r$ contains $t+1$ vertices of $H$ and, for each $x\in V(T)\setminus\{r\}$, $B_x$ includes exactly one vertex of $H$ that is not in its parent $B_p$ where $p$ is the $T$-parent of $x$.
For a rooted tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of a graph $H$ and any $v\in V(H)$, we use the notation $x_T(v)$ to denote the minimum $T$-depth node $x\in V(T)$ such that $v\in B_x$.  This induces a partial order $\prec_{\mathcal{T}}$ on $V(H)$ in which $v\prec_{\mathcal{T}} w$ if and only if $x_T(v)\prec_T x_T(w)$.

The following observation relates construction orders, orders induced by BFS layerings, and orders induced by canonical tree decompositions:

\begin{obs}\label{order-relation}
    Let $H$ be a $t$-tree with construction order $\mathcal{R}:=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ that generates a canonical tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$, and let $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{\min\{n,t\}}\}$.  For any $v,w\in V(H)$,
    if $v\prec_{\mathcal{T}} w$ or $v\prec_{\mathcal{L}} w$ then $v<_{\mathcal{R}} w$.
\end{obs}

\begin{obs}\label{dominant-parent}
    Let $H$ be a $t$-tree with construction order $\mathcal{R}:=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ and let $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{\min\{t,n\}}\}$.  Then, for any $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ and any vertex $v\in L_{i}$ with dominant parent $p$, $p\in L_{i-1}$.
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}
    A well-known property of BFS layerings is that, for $i>0$, any vertex $v\in L_{i}$ has some neighbour $w\in L_{i-1}$.  By definition, $p\le_\mathcal{R} w$ so, by \cref{order-relation} $p\le_\mathcal{L} w$. Since $w\in L_{i-1}$, $p\in L_0\cup\cdots\cup L_{i-1}$.  Another well known property of BFS layerings is that $v$ has no neighbour in $L_0,\ldots,L_{i-2}$.  Therefore $p\in L_{i-1}$.
\end{proof}

The following simple result is used several times in the (fairly involved) proof of \cref{simple-t-trees}.  We note that the vertices $p,q,v$ in the statement of the result are not necessarily distinct.

\begin{obs}\label{up-clique}
    Let $H$ be a $t$-tree with construction order $\mathcal{R}:=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$, let $\mathcal{L}:=(L_0,\ldots,L_m)$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0:=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{\min\{t,n\}}\}$, let $i\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$, let $uvw$ be a path in $H$ with $u,w\in L_{i+1}$, $v\in L_{i}$, and let $p,q\in L_{i}$ be the dominant parents of $u$ and $w$ respectively.  Then $H[\{v,p,q\}]$ is a clique.
\end{obs}

% We remark that, in \cref{up-clique} $\{v,p,q\}$ may consist of $1$, $2$, or $3$ distinct elements.

\begin{proof}
    Refer to \cref{up-clique-figure}. Consider the canonical tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ generated by $v_1,\ldots,v_n$.  By \cref{order-relation}, $v\prec_{\mathcal{T}} u,w$ and, by definition $p,q\preceq_{\mathcal{T}} v$.  Therefore $p,q\prec_{\mathcal{T}} v\prec_{\mathcal{T}} u,w$.  Since $pu\in E(H)$, this implies that $p\in B_{x_T(v)}$.  Similarly $q\in B_{x_T(v)}$.  By definition, $v\in B_{x_T(v)}$.  The vertices in $B_{x_T(v)}$ form a clique in $H$, so $\{v,p,q\}$ is a clique in $H$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Simple Treewidth}


A tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of a graph $H$ is \emph{$t$-simple} if it has width $t$ and, for every $t$-element subset $S\subseteq V(H)$, $|\{x\in V(T):S\subseteq B_x\}|\le 2$.  The simple treewidth $\stw(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $H$ has a $t$-simple tree decomposition \cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple}.  A $t$-tree $H$ is a \emph{simple} $t$-tree if its canonical tree decompositions are $t$-simple.\footnote{Although a simple $t$-tree $H$ has different canonical tree decompositions depending on the choice of $v_1,\ldots,v_t$ in the construction order, each of these tree decompositions $(B_x:x\in V(T))$ generates the same set $\{B_x:x\in V(T)\}$ of bags that have a bijection with the $t+1$ cliques of $H$.  Therefore all of these tree decompositions are $t$-simple or none of them are.}  Though it appears implicitly, several times in the literature, \citet{knauer.ueckerdt:simple} define simple treewidth.  \citet{markenzon.justel.ea:subclasses} define simple $t$-trees (which they call Simple Clique (SC) $t$-trees).


\begin{lem}[\cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple}]\label{simple-minor-closed}
    For every graph $G$ and every minor $M$ of $G$, $\stw(M)\le\stw(G)$.
\end{lem}

We work with simple $t$-trees because they arise naturally:

\begin{lem}[\cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple,markenzon.justel.ea:subclasses}]\label{simple-small-cases}
    A graph $H$ is
    \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
        \item a simple $1$-tree if and only if $H$ is a path.
        \item a simple $2$-tree if and only if $H$ is an edge-maximal outerplanar graph;
        \item a simple $3$-tree if and only if $H$ is a planar 3-tree.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

Simple treewidth and treewidth are closely related:

\begin{lem}\label{simple-treewidth-vs-treewidth}\cite{knauer.ueckerdt:simple}
    For every graph $G$, $\tw(G)\le \stw(G)\le \tw(G)+1$.
\end{lem}

The following two results are easy, but we are unable to find a reference that proves them, so we include proofs for completeness.  The case $t=2$ of the following lemma is well known: Every outerplanar graph is a subgraph of some edge-maximal outerplanar graph.  The case $t=3$ was proven by \citet{kratochvil.vaner:note}, who note that it is also implicit in earlier work of \citet{elmallah.colbourn:on}.

\begin{lem}\label{simple-subgraph}
    For any graph $G$ with $\stw(G)\le t$, there exists a simple $t$-tree $H$ with $V(G)= V(H)$ and $E(G)\subseteq E(H)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    If $|G|\le t+1$, then the result is trivial, so suppose that $|G|>t+1$.
    Let $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ be a $t$-simple tree decomposition of $G$.  We will transform $\mathcal{T}$ into a canonical decomposition of $H$.

    We say that a node $x\in V(T)$ is \emph{redundant} if it has a neighbour $y$ such that $B_x\subseteq B_y$.  We say that $\mathcal{T}$ is \emph{concise} if $T$ has no redundant nodes.  We may assume that $\mathcal{T}$ is concise since,  if $B_x\subseteq B_y$ for some $xy\in E(T)$ then we can contract $x$ into $y$ without affecting $t$-simplicity.  Repeating this exhaustively ensures that $\mathcal{T}$ is concise.

    Next, we do transformations on $T$ (if necessary) so that $|B_r|=t+1$ for at least one node $r\in V(T)$. Let $r$ be a node in $T$ that maximizes $|B_r|$. As long as $|B_r|<t+1$ we find a neighbour $x$ of $r$ and add an element of $B_x\setminus B_r$ to $B_r$.  If this causes $B_x$ to become redundant (because $B_x\subset B_r$) the we contract $x$ into $r$.  To see that this operation maintains $t$-simplicity, suppose that, after the operation some $t$-element subset of $V(G)$ appears in $B_r$, $B_x$, and $B_y$ for some node $y$ adjacent to $x$.  Since $B_y$ and $B_x$ are not changed by the operation, $C\subseteq B_x\cap B_y$.  But $|B_y|\le t$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is concise, so $|C|\le|B_x\cap B_y|\le|B_y|-1= t-1$, a contradiction. Thus we may assume that $T$ is rooted at a node $r$ with $|B_r|=t+1$.

    Now, we say that $\mathcal{T}$ is \emph{maximally deep} if no node $x$ has two children $y$ and $z$ with $B_y\cap B_x\subseteq B_z\cap B_x$.  If such a configuration of nodes exists, then we can remove the edge $xy$ and add the edge $zy$, to make $y$ a child of $z$.  This does not affect $t$-simplicity and increases the total path length of $T$, which is upper bounded by $(|T|^2+|T|)/2$ and, since $T$ is concise and has at least one node $r$ with $|B_r|=t+1$, $|T|\le n-t$.  Therefore after a finite number of such operations, $\mathcal{T}$ is maximally deep.

    We say that a node $x\in V(T)$ with parent $p$ is \emph{incremental} if $|B_x\setminus B_y|=1$ and use the convention that the root $r$ is always incremental.  We say that $x$ is \emph{maximal} if $|B_x|=t+1$.  We say that $\mathcal{T}$ is \emph{uniform} if, for each $x\in V(T)\setminus\{r\}$, $x$ is incremental and maximal.  Observe that, if $\mathcal{T}$ is uniform then $\mathcal{T}$ is a canonical tree decomposition of a simple $t$-tree $H$, and we are done.

    If $\mathcal{T}$ is not uniform, then there exists $x\in V(T)$ such that every $T$-ancestor of $x$, including $x$, is incremental and maximal, but some child $y$ of $x$ is not incremental or not maximal.  Observe that $|B_x\cap B_y| < t$, otherwise $y$ is redundant (because $|B_y|\le t$ so $B_y=B_x\cap B_y$) or $y$ is maximal and incremental (because $|B_y|=t+1$ so $|B_y\setminus B_x|=|B_y|-|B_x\cap B_y|=1$).

    If $|B_y|\le t$ then take some element $v$ from $B_x\setminus B_y$ and add it to $B_y$.  We claim that, if we choose the correct element $v$, then this preserves the $t$-simplicity of $\mathcal{T}$.  Suppose otherwise, so that  $C:=(B_x\cap B_y)\cup\{v\}$ is contained $B_z$ for some node $z\in V(T)\setminus\{x,y\}$.  There are three cases to consider:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $z$ is a child of $x$:  This is not possible since $\mathcal{T}$ is maximally deep, so $B_x\cap B_y\not\subseteq B_z$.
        \item $z$ is a child of $y$:  This is not possible since, before the operation, $v\not\in B_y$, and $v\in B_x$, so $v\not\in B_z$.
        \item $z$ is the parent of $x$:  Since $|B_x|=t+1$ and $|B_x\cap B_y|<t$, there exists two elements $v,w\in B_x\setminus B_y$.  Since $x$ and $z$ are maximal and incremental $|B_x\setminus B_z|=1$. Therefore, at least one of $v$ or $w$ is not contained in $B_z$ and, without loss of generality we assume it is $v$.  But then $v\not\in B_z$ so $C\not\subseteq B_z$.
    \end{compactenum}

    If $|B_y|=t+1$ then consider the subtree $T_y$ of $T$ containing all $T$-descendants of $y$, including $y$.  $T_y$ has a subtree $T_y'$ containing all nodes $z$ such that $B_z\supseteq B_x\cap B_y$.  The tree $T_y'$ is non-empty and therefore contains some node $z$ that has no children in $T_y'$.  We replace the edge $xy$ in $T$ with $xz$.  This does not change the fact that $\mathcal{T}$ is a $t$-simple tree decomposition of $G$.  The point now is that

    If $T_y'$ contains a node $z$ with $|B_z|<t+1$, then we do this and the algorithm continues.  Otherwise, $T_y'$
    %
    %
    % (Assume that $|B_x\cap B_y|=t-1$, otherwise things are easy.)
    %
    % If $|B_y|=t+1$ then, let $C:=(B_x\cap B_y)\cup \{v\}$ where $v$ is defined as above (so $v$ does not appear in the bag of the parent of $x$).  Let $\{v_1,\ldots,v_d\}:=B_y\setminus B_x$.  Since $|B_x\cap B_y|<t$, $d\ge 2$.
    %
    %
    %  There are some cases to consider:
    %
    % \begin{compactenum}
    %
    %     \item If $y$ has a child $z$ such that $v_1\cup (B_x\cap B_y)\not\subseteq B_z$, then we replace $xy$ with a path $xx'y$ where $B_{x'}:C\cup\{v_1\}$.  This preserves $t$-simplicity since the only new $t$-clique to worry about is $v_1\cup (B_x\cap B_y)$ but this only appears in $B_y$ (and now in $B_{x'}$).
    %
    %     \item Otherwise, $y$ has exactly one child $z$ such that $v_1\in B_z$.  Now, observe that $C':=(B_x\cap B_y)\cup\{v_1\}$ is contained in $B_y$ and $B_z$.  Therefore,
    %
    %
    % arguing as above, there is a vertex $v$ that appears only in $B_x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{simple-bfs-layers}
    Let $H$ be a simple $t$-tree, let $n:=|H|$, let $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ be a construction order for $H$, and let $L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be the BFS ordering of $H$ with $L_0:=v_1,\ldots,v_{\min\{t,n\}}$.   Then, for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, $\stw(H[L_i])\le t-1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Delete BFS layers $L_{i+1},\ldots,L_m$ and contract BFS layers $L_0,\ldots,L_{i-1}$ into a single vertex $v_0$ to obtain a minor $H'$ of $H$ in which $v_0$ is a dominant vertex.  By \cref{simple-minor-closed}, $\stw(H')\le t$, so $H'$ has a $t$-simple tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}':=(B_x:x\in V(T))$.  Since $v_0$ is a dominant vertex, $v_0$ appears in every bag of $\mathcal{T}'$.  Therefore $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x\setminus\{v_0\}:x\in V(T))$ is a $(t-1)$-simple tree decomposition of $H'-\{v_0\}=H[L_i]$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Product Structure}

For two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the \emph{strong graph product} of $G_1$ and $G_2$, denoted $G_1\boxtimes G_2$, is a graph whose vertex set is the Cartesian product $V(G_1\boxtimes G_2)= V(G_1)\times V(G_2)$ and that contains an edge between $v=(v_1,v_2)$ and $w=(w_1,w_2)$ if and only if
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item $v_1=w_1$ and $v_2w_2\in E(G_2)$;
    \item $v_2=w_2$ and $v_1w_1\in E(G_1)$; or
    \item $v_1w_1\in E(G_1)$ and $v_2w_2\in E(G_2)$.
\end{inparaenum}

The following recent result of \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}, which builds on earlier work of \citet{pilipczuk.siebertz:polynomial}, shows that every planar graph is the subgraph of a strong product of very simple graphs.

\begin{thm}\cite{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}\label{product-structure}
    For every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, there exists an at most $n$-vertex planar 3-tree $H$ and a path $P$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P$.
\end{thm}

As the following simple lemma shows, product structure is highly relevant to 2-ranking:

\begin{lem}\label{product-lemma}
    For any two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, $\trn(G_1\boxtimes G_2)\le \trn(G_1)\cdot\dtcn(G_2)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    For each $(x,y)\in V(G_1\boxtimes G_2)$, let $\varphi(x,y)=\trn(G_2)\cdot \rho(x) - \psi(y)$ where $\rho:V(G_1)\to\{1,\ldots,\trn(G_1)\}$ is a 2-ranking of $G_1$ and $\psi:V(G_2)\to\{0,\ldots,\dtcn(G_2)-1\}$ is a distance-2 colouring of $G_2$.

    Clearly $\varphi:V(G_1\boxtimes G_2)\to \{1,\ldots,\trn(G_1)\cdot\dtcn(G_2)\}$ is a proper colouring of $G_1\boxtimes G_2$.  To see that $\varphi$ is a 2-ranking, consider any path $uvw$ in $G_1\boxtimes G_2$ where $u:=(u_1,u_2)$, $v:=(v_1,v_2)$ and $w:=(w_1,w_2)$.  We must show that $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$ or that $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$.  Consider the following exhaustive list of possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $u_1,v_1,w_1$ is a path in $G_1$ then, since $\rho$ is a 2-ranking of $G_1$, $\rho(u_1)\neq\rho(w_1)$ or $\rho(v_1)>\rho(u_1)$ so $\varphi(u)\neq \varphi(w)$ or $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$.

        \item If $u_1w_1$ is an edge of $G_1$ then, since $\rho$ is a proper colouring of $G_1$, $\rho(u_1)\neq\rho(w_1)$, so $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$.

        \item If $u_1v_1w_1$ is not a path in $G_1$ and $u_1w_1$ is not an edge in $G_1$ (so neither Case~1 nor Case~2 applies) then $u_1=w_1$.  Therefore, since $u\neq w$, $u_2\neq w_2$. Since $\psi$ is a distance-2 colouring of $G_2$, $\psi(u_2)\neq\psi(w_2)$ so $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$.
         \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Note that the graph $K_3\boxtimes P$, which appears in \cref{product-structure}, has maximum degree 8 so it its square $(K_3\boxtimes P)^2$ has maximum degree at most $8\cdot 7=56$.  Since distance-2 colouring any graph is equivalent to colouring its square, this implies that $\dtcn(K_3\boxtimes P)\le 57$.


Since $K_3\boxtimes P$ appears in \cref{product-structure}, the following result is useful:

\begin{lem}\label{dumb}
    For any path $P$, $\dtcn(K_3\boxtimes P)\le 9$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Order the vertices of $K_3\boxtimes P$ as $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_{3|P|},y_{3|P|})$ so that, if $y_i$ appears before $y_j$ in $P$, then $i<j$. For each $j\in\{1,\ldots,3|P|\}$, let $I_j\subset\{1,\ldots,j-1\}$ be the set of indices $i$ such that $K_3\boxtimes P$ contains a non-trivial path of length at most 2 with endpoints $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$.  It is easy to verify that $|I_j|\le 8$.  For each $j\in\{1,\ldots,3|P|\}$, set $\varphi(x_j,y_j):=\min(\{1,\ldots,9\}\setminus\{\varphi(x_i,y_i):i\in I_j\})$.  This gives a distance-2 colouring $\varphi:K_3\boxtimes P\to\{1,\ldots,9\}$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Inequalities for Iterated Logarithms}

For any $x> 0$ and $a\ge 0$, we have the inequality,
\begin{equation}
    \log (x+a) = \log (x(1+a/x)) = \log x + \log(1+a/x) \le \log x + \log e^{a/x} = \log x + \frac{a}{x} \enspace , \label{log-x-plus-a}
\end{equation}
where the inequality follows from the inequality $e^z \le 1+z$, valid for all $z\in\R$.

Define the \emph{$\tau$ower} function $\tau:\N\to\N$ by
\[
  \tau(i) :=
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{for $i=0$} \\
        e^{\tau(i-1)} & \text{for $i\ge 1$.} \\
    \end{cases}
\]
Recall that, for any integer $i\ge 0$,
\[
    \log^{(i)} x :=
      \begin{cases}
          x & \text{for $i=0$} \\
          \log\left(\log^{(i-1)}x\right) & \text{for $i\ge 1$.} \\
      \end{cases}
\]

For any $x > \tau(i-1)$ and any $a\ge 0$, \cref{log-x-plus-a} generalizes as follows (by induction on $i$):
\begin{equation}
    \log^{(i)}(x+a) \le \log^{(i)} x + \frac{a}{\prod_{j=0}^{i-1}\log^{(j)} x} \label{logi-x-plus-a}
\end{equation}

In several places we have ratios involving iterated logarithms, in which case we make use of the following consequence of \cref{logi-x-plus-a}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\log^{(i)} x+a}{\log^{(i)} x} \le 1 + \frac{a}{\prod_{j=0}^{i}\log^{(j)} x} \enspace, \label{logi-ratio}
\end{equation}
which is again valid for all $x> \tau(i-1)$.

%========================================================================
\section{Lower Bounds}
\label{lower-bounds}

We now prove the lower bound in \cref{t-trees}, which establishes all the other lower bounds. The idea in this lower bound is to construct a $t$-tree $G$ that has a BFS layering $L_0,\ldots,L_m$ such that, for each $i,\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$ and each vertex $a\in L_i$, $G[N_G(a)\cap L_{i+1}]$ is a collection of $(t-1)$-trees $U_{a,0},\ldots,U_{a,k}$, each of which is a copy of a small $(t-1)$-tree $U$ that requires at least $h$ colours.  This forces the colour of $a$ to exceed, by at least $h+1$, the smallest colour used in $U_{a,0},\ldots,U_{a,k}$.  Proceeding bottom up, this forces the vertex in $L_0$ to receive a colour larger than $(h+1)m$.  The lower bound is then obtained by using induction on $t$ to upper bound the size of the $(t-1)$-tree $U$ need that has $\trn(U)\ge h$ and choosing the parameters $h$ and $m$ appropriately.

\begin{lem}\label{apex-graph}
    Let $h,k\ge 1$ be integers, let $U$ be a graph with $\trn(U)\ge h$ and let $G$ be a graph obtained by taking $k+1$ disjoint copies $U_0,\ldots,U_k$ of $U$ and adding an apex vertex $a$ adjacent to each $v\in\bigcup_{i=0}^k V(U_i)$.  Then, for any integer $k_0\in \{1,\ldots,k\}$ and any 2-ranking of $\varphi:V(G)\to\{k_0,\ldots,k\}$, $\varphi(a) \ge k_0+h$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $\trn(U_i)\ge h$, there exists $v_i\in V(U_i)$ such that $\varphi(v_i)\ge k_0+h-1$, for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,k\}$.  Since $|\{0,\ldots,k\}|=k+1>k-k_0+1=|\{k_0,\ldots,k\}|$ the Pigeonhole Principle implies that there exists distinct $i,j\in\{0,\ldots,k\}$ such that $\varphi(v_i)=\varphi(v_j)$.  Since $v_i a v_j$ is a path in $G$, this implies that $\varphi(a)\ge \varphi(v_i)+1\ge k_0+h$.
\end{proof}

For a graph $U$ and integers $h,m\ge 0$, we define the \emph{$(h,m)$-boost} $U^{(h,m)}$ of $U$ as follows: The vertex set of $U^{(h,m)}$ is the disjoint union of $L_0,\ldots,L_m$.  The set $L_0:=\{a_0\}$ consists of a single vertex. For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ and each $a\in L_{i-1}$, $U^{(h,m)}$ contains $hm+1$ disjoint copies $U_{a,0},\ldots,U_{a,hm}$ of $U$ and contains the edge $av$ for each $v\in\bigcup_{j=0}^{hm} V(U_{a,j})$.  This determines the set $L_i=\bigcup_{a\in L_{i-1}}\bigcup_{j=0}^{hm} V(U_{a,j})$.  As a simple example, if $U$ is a 1-vertex graph, then $U^{(h,m)}$ is a complete $(hm+1)$-ary tree of height $m$.

\begin{lem}\label{boost}
    For any graph $U$, any integer $m\ge 0$, and any $h\ge\trn(U)$, $\trn(U^{(h,m)})\ge hm +1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\trn(U^{(h,m)})=k<hm+1$ and let $\varphi:V(U^{(h,m)})\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$ be a 2-ranking of $U_{(h,m)}$.  Let $L_0,\ldots,L_{m}$ be the partition of $V(U^{(h,m)})$ used in the definition of $V(U^{(h,m)})$.
    We will show by induction on $m-i$ that, for each $a\in L_{i}$, $\varphi(a)\ge(m-i)h+1$. This gives the desired contradiction since it implies that, for the unique vertex $a_0\in L_0$, $\varphi(a_0)\ge m h+1 > k$.

    The base case of the induction, $m-i=0$, is trivial; it simply asserts that $\varphi(v)\ge 1$ for each $v\in L_m$.  For any $i\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}$ we apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that $\varphi(v)\in\{(m-i-1)h+1,\ldots,k\}$ for each $v\in L_{i+1}$.  For each $a\in L_i$, the subgraph of $U^{(h,m)}$ induced by $a$ and its neighbours in $L_{i+1}$ contains the graph described in \cref{apex-graph} with $k_0:=(m-i-1)h+1$.  The conclusion of \cref{apex-graph} therefore implies that $\varphi(a)\ge k_0+h=(m-i)h+1$, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{boost-size}
    For any graph $U$ and any integers $h,m \ge 1$, $|U^{(h,m)}| \le (|U|\cdot h\cdot m)^{m}\cdot (1+O((|U|hm)^{-1})$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    It is easy to see that, for each $i\in \{0,\ldots,m\}$, $|L_i|=(|U|(hm+1))^i$.  Therefore,
    \[ |U^{h,m}| = \sum_{i=0}^m |L_i| = \sum_{i=0}^m (|U|(hm+1))^i = (|U|(hm))^{m}\cdot (1+O((|U|hm)^{-1}) \enspace . \qedhere
    \]
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{boost-treewidth}
    For any graph $U$ and any integers $h,m\ge 1$, $\tw(U^{(h,m)})\le \tw(U)+1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Create a width-$(\tw(U)+1)$ tree-decomposition $(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $U^{(h,m)}$ as follows: Start with $T$ having a single node $z_0$ with $B_{z_0}=L_0$.  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, and each $a\in L_{i-1}$, find some bag $B_z$ in the current decomposition that contains $a$, take $h+1$ disjoint copies $(A_x:x\in V(T_0)),\ldots,(A_x:x\in V(T_h))$ of some width-$t$ tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of $U$.  For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,h\}$, add an edge from $z$ to any node of the tree in $T_i$ and add $a$ to every bag in $T_i$.  It is straightforward to verify that this does, indeed, give a width-$\tw(U)+1$ tree-decomposition of $U^{(h,m)}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}\label{treewidth-lower-bound}
    For each integer $t\ge 1$ and any integer $r\ge \tau(t)$, there exists a graph $G$, with $|G|\le (\log^{(t-1)}r)^{tr + o(r)}$, $\tw(G)\le t$, and $\trn(G)\ge r$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $t$.  The base case $t=1$ has already been established by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on} who show that the complete $(r+1)$-ary tree $T$ of height $r-1$ has $\trn(T)\ge r$.  The tree $T$ has size $\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} (r+1)^i \le r^r=(\log^{(0)}r)^{r}$.  This establishes the result for $t=1$.

    Let $h:=\lceil\log r\rceil$ and $m:=\lceil r/\log r\rceil$ so that $hm\ge r$.  For $t>1$ we can apply the inductive hypothesis to obtain a graph $U$,     with $\tw(U)\le t-1$, $|U|=(\log^{(t-2)} h)^{(t-1)h}$ and $\trn(U)\ge h$.
    Now we take the graph $G:=U^{(h,m)}$.  By \cref{boost-treewidth}, $\tw(G)\le \tw(U)+1\le t$.  By \cref{boost},
    $\trn(G)\ge hm+1 > hm \ge r$.

    % In the following calculation we ignore the ceilings in the definitions of $h$ and $m$.
    By \cref{boost-size},
    \begin{align*}
        |G| & \le (|U|\cdot m\cdot h)^{m} \\
        & \le \left((\log^{(t-2)} h)^{(t-1)h + o(h)}\cdot m\cdot h\right)^{m} \\
        & = (\log^{(t-2)} h)^{(t-1)r + o(r)}\cdot r^{m} \\
        & = (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{(t-1)r + o(r)}\cdot r^{r/log r+o(r)} \\
        % & \text{(since $h:=\log r$)}\\
        % & = (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{(t-1)r + o(r)}\cdot r^{r/\log r}
        % & \text{(since $m:=r/\log r$)}\\
        & = (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{(t-1)r + o(r)}\cdot e^{r+o(r)} \\
        & \le (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{tr + o(r)} & \text{(since $r\ge \tau(t)$, so $\log^{(t-1)} r\ge e$).} & \qedhere
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{t-trees} (lower bound)]
    \Cref{treewidth-lower-bound} produces a graph $G$ of size $n \le (\log^{(t-1)} r)^{tr+o(r)}$ and $\trn(G)\ge r$.  So,
    \[  \log n \le (tr+o(r))\log^{(t)} r = t\cdot(1+o(1))\trn(G)\log^{(t)} \trn(G)\]
    and attempting to solve for $\trn(G)$ shows that $\trn(G)\in \Omega(\log n/\log^{(t+1)} n)$.
\end{proof}

\section{Upper Bounds}
\label{upper-bounds}

In this section we prove asymptotically tight bounds for the worst-case number of colours needed to 2-rank $n$-vertex simple $t$-trees.

\subsection{Simple $t$-Trees}

This section is devoted to proving the upper bound in \cref{simple-t-trees}:

\begin{namedtheorem}[\weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}]\weirdlabel{simple-t-trees}{a}
    For every fixed $t\ge 1$ and every $n$-vertex simple $t$-tree $H$, $\trn(H)\in O(\log n/\log^{(t)} n)$.
\end{namedtheorem}

\weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} immediately implies the upper bounds in \cref{planar,t-trees}:

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{planar} (upper bound)]
    By \cref{product-structure}, $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P$ where $H$ is an at most $n$-vertex planar 3-tree and $P$ is a path. By \cref{simple-small-cases}(iii) $H$ is a simple 3-tree. Therefore,
    \begin{align*}
        \trn(G) & \le \trn(H\boxtimes K_3\boxtimes P) \\
                & \le \trn(H)\cdot \dtcn(K_3\boxtimes P)
                    & \text{(by \cref{product-structure})}\\
                & \le 9\trn(H) & \text{(by \cref{dumb})} \\
                & \in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n) & \text{(by \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}).} & \qedhere
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{t-trees} (upper bound)]
    By \cref{simple-treewidth-vs-treewidth}, the $t$-tree $H$ is a subgraph of an $n$-vertex simple $(t+1)$-tree $H'$ so $\trn(H)\le \trn(H')$ and, by   \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}, $\trn(H')\in O(n\log^{(t+1)}n)$.
\end{proof}

\weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} also has the following corollary, which strengthens \cref{trees}:

\begin{cor}\label{outerplanar}
    For every $n$-vertex outerplanar graph $G$, $\trn(G)\in O(n/\log^{(2)} n)$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
    Without loss of generality, we may assume that $G$ is edge-maximal so, by \cref{simple-small-cases}{(ii)}, $G$ is a simple $2$-tree and, by \cref{simple-t-trees} $\trn(G)\in O(\log n/\log^{(2)} n)$.
\end{proof}


The proof of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} is the most technically demanding part of the paper, so we give a brief overview of the proof strategy before delving into the details.  The proof is by induction on the value of $t$.  The base, $t=1$, is easy: By \cref{simple-small-cases}(i), every simple 1-tree is forest of paths, which has a 2-ranking using 3 colours.  In the general case, we need to prove that $H$ has a 2-ranking using colours $\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ for some constant $a$ and some $k\in O(\log n/\log^{(t)} n)$.  An asymptotically equivalent statement of this is: If $n \le (\log^{(t-2)}k)^k$, then $H$ has a 2-ranking using colours $\{1,\ldots,ak\}$, and this is the version of the statement that we prove.

We use a BFS layering $L_1,\ldots,L_m$ of $H$ and use the fact (\cref{simple-bfs-layers}) that each layer $L_i$ induces a simple $(t-1)$-forest $H[L_i]$, on which we can apply \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} inductively.\footnote{Here, and throughout, we make use of the fact $\trn(H)$ is monotone: it does not decrease when edges are added to $H$ and the fact (\cref{simple-subgraph}) that any graph $H$ with $\stw(H)\le t$ is a subgraph of some simple $t$-tree $H'$ with $V(H')=V(H)$ and $E(H')\supseteq E(H)$.}  The main difficulty with this approach is that a vertex $v$ in $H[L_i]$ dominates an entire simple $(t-1)$-forest $F$ in $H[L_{i+1}]$.  If some colour $\phi$ is used more than once in the colouring of $F$, then $v$ must be assigned a colour larger than $\phi$.

To account for this, we use a strengthening of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} that applies to any simple $t$-forest $H'$ contained in $H[L_{i+1}\cup\cdots\cup L_m]$.  This strengthening shows that, if $H'$ has size at most $(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} c)^c$ then $H'$ has a 2-ranking using colours $\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ in which no colour larger than $a(k-c-1)$ appears more than once in the first layer, $H'[L_{i+1}]$.  In essence, the size of $H'$ provides a lower bound, $a(k-c-1)$, on the colour assigned to some vertex $v$ in $L_i$.

It turns out to be easier to forget about $L_{i+1},\ldots,L_{m}$ and to work, instead, with a simple $(t-1)$-forest $H'$ contained in $H[L_i]$, in which each vertex $v$ is assigned a lower bound $a(k-\gamma(v)-1)$ on its colour.  This lower bound can also be interpreted as a weight  $(\log^{(t-2)}k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)}\gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}$ that describes the size of the $t$-forest $H_v$ in $H[L_{i+1}\cup\cdots\cup L_m]$ whose first layer $H_v[L_{i+1}]$ is dominated by $v$.  The condition that $H'$ has size at most $(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} c)^c$ translates roughly into the condition
\[
   \sum_{v\in V(H')}\frac{(\log^{(t-2)}k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)}\gamma(v)^{\gamma(v)}} \le \frac{(k\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(c\log^{(t-2)} c)^c}
\]
We are able to show that $H'$ has a special kind of separator $S$ of size $O(c)$ such that
\begin{compactenum}
    \item $H'[S]$ can be 2-ranked using $O(c)$ large colours in $\{a(k-c-1)+1,\ldots,ak\}$ that are each used only once; and
    \item Each component of $H'-S$ can be 2-ranked using $O(k-c)$ small colours $\{1,\ldots,a(k-c-1)\}$.
\end{compactenum}
Each of these colourings respect the lower bounds given by $\gamma(v)$ for each vertex $v$ of $H'$.

The preceding proof sketch ignores a difficulty caused by the fact that simple $t$-forests in $H[L_{i+1}\cup\cdots\cup L_m]$ are attached to $t$-cliques in $H[L_i]$ rather than individual vertices of $H[L_i]$.  When we treat each of these forests individually, we run into the problem that there may be two $t$-cliques $C_1$ and $C_2$ of $H[L_i]$ with a vertex $v$ in common.  A simple $(t-1)$-forest $F_1$ attached to $C_1$ may avoid using colours larger than $a(k-c)$ more than once and a forest $F_2$ attached to $C_2$ may avoid using colours larger than $a(k-c-1)$ more than once.  Nevertheless, $F_1$ may have one vertex $u$ of colour $\phi >a(k-c-1)$ and $F_2$ may also have one vertex $w$ of colour $\phi$.  Since $uvw$ is a path in $H$, $v$'s colour must be larger than $\phi$.  We get around this by using an auxilliary colouring $\zeta$ of the $t$-cliques in $H[L_i]$ so that if two $t$-cliques $C_1$ and $C_2$ have a vertex in common and the preceding situation occurs, then $\zeta(C_1)\neq \zeta(C_2)$.  The vertices in $F_1$ receive the secondary colour $\zeta(C_1)$ and the vertices in $F_2$ receive the secondary colour $\zeta(C_2)$.  In this way, the vertices $u$ and $w$ described above receive different colours.

With this proof sketch complete, we now begin with the actual proof.

\subsubsection{Some Combination Lemmas}

\begin{lem}\label{pathwidth}
    For any graph $H$, $\trn(H)\le 3\pw(H) + 1$
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $\pw(H)$.  The base case $\pw(H)=0$ is trivial: In this case, $H$ contains no edges and can be 2-ranked with $1 = 3\pw(H)+1$ colours.

    For $\pw(H)>1$, it is well known that $H$ contains a sequence of vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_m$  such that
    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item $H$ contains no edge $v_iv_j$ with $|i-j|>1$;
        \item $H$ contains no path $v_iw v_j$ with $w\not\in\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ and $|i-j|>1$; and
        \item $\pw(H-\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\})\le \pw(H)-1$.
    \end{inparaenum}
    Property~(iii) implies that we can therefore inductively colour $H-\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ using colours $\{1,\ldots,3\pw(H)-2\}$ and then colour each $v_i$ with colour $3\pw(H)-1+i\bmod 3$.  Property~(i) ensures that this gives a 2-ranking of $H[v_1,\ldots,v_m]$.  Property~(ii) and the fact that $v_1,\ldots,v_m$ are coloured using larger colours than those used to colour $H-\{v_1,\ldots,v_m\}$ ensures that the resulting colouring is a 2-ranking of $H$.
\end{proof}

A node $x$ in a rooted tree $T$ is a \emph{branching node} if $x$ has at least two children.  Let $\Lambda(T)$ denote the set of branching nodes in a tree $T$. For a graph $H$ with a rooted tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$, we define the $\mathcal{T}$-skeleton $\hat{H}$ of $H$ as the graph with vertex set $V(\hat{H}):=\bigcup_{x\in \Lambda(T)} B_x$ and containing the edge $vw$ if there exists $x,y\in V(T)$ with $v\in B_x$, $w\in B_y$ such that the path in $T$ from $x$ to $y$ contains no branching node in its interior.  It is worth noting that the skeleton $\hat{H}$ of $H$ is a minor of $H$ since it can be obtained from $H$ by repeatedly contracting an edge $vw$ with $v\in V(\hat{H})$ and $w\not\in V(\hat{H})$ into $v$. By \cref{simple-minor-closed} this implies that, if $H$ is a simple $t$-tree then $\hat{H}$ is also a simple $t$-tree.

\begin{obs}\label{skeleton-size}
    Let $H$ be a (simple) $t$-tree and let $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ be a simple width-$t$ tree decomposition of $H$.  Then the $\mathcal{T}$-skeleton $\hat{H}$ of $H$ is also a simple $t$-tree and has a simple tree decomposition $(B_x:x\in V(\hat{T}))$ where $|\hat{T}|=|\Lambda(T)|$ and therefore $|\hat{H}|\le (t+1)|\Lambda(T)|$.
\end{obs}

\begin{lem}\label{skeleton-colour}
    Let $H$ be a graph having a width-$t$ tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$, and let $\hat{H}$ be the $\mathcal{T}$-skeleton of $H$.  Then $\trn(H)\le \trn(\hat{H}) + 3t+1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\varphi:V(\hat{H})\to \{3t+2,\ldots,\trn(\hat{H})+3t+1\}$ be a 2-ranking of $\hat{H}$. The graph $P:=T-\Lambda(T)$ consists of disjoint paths and, for any edge $vw\in E(H-V(\hat{H}))$ there is a node $x\in V(P)$ such that $\{v,w\}\subseteq B_x$.  Therefore $(B_x:x\in V(P))$ is a width-$t$ path decomposition of $H-V(\hat{H})$, so $\pw(H-V(\hat{H}))\le t$.  Therefore, by \cref{pathwidth}, $H-V(\hat{H})$ has a 2-ranking $\varphi:V(H-V(\hat{H}))\to\{1,\ldots,3t+1\}$.  This gives the desired colouring $\varphi: V(H)\to\{1,\ldots,\trn(\hat{H})+3t+1\}$.  To see why $\varphi$ is a 2-ranking of $H$ observe that for any path $uvw$ with $u,w\in V(\hat{H})$ and $v\in V(H)\setminus V(\hat{H})$, the edge $uw\in\hat{H}$, so $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{The Meat}

Recall that we are working on a proof of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} that works by induction on $t$ and the base case $t=1$ is easy ($H$ is a path so $\trn(H)\le 3$). \Cref{simple-bfs-layers,simple-subgraph} says that each BFS layer $H[L_i]$ is contained in a simple $(t-1)$-tree.  Before working directly with $t$-trees we will work with vertex-weighted $(t-1)$-trees and $(t-1)$-forests in which each node $v$ is given a lower bound $a(k-\lambda(v)-1)+1$ on its colour.

The next two lemmata will eventually be applied to (subgraphs of) BFS layers of $H$, which is why they are stated in terms of $(t-1)$-trees.  The first lemma gives a \emph{slackness} condition that makes it possible to find a colouring that does not use \emph{any} colour larger than $a(k-c-1)$.

\begin{lem}\label{t-tree-slack}
Let $t,k\in\N$ and $c\in\R$ with $t\ge 2$ and $\tau(t)\le c\le k-1$; let $H$ be a simple $(t-1)$-tree; let $t':=\min\{t, |H|\}$; let $v_1,\ldots,v_{|H|}$ be a construction order for $H$ generating a canonical tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ rooted at $r\in V(T)$; let $\gamma:V(H)\to\{z\in\R: z\ge \tau(t-1)\}$; and let
\[
    n_r:=\sum_{v\in V(H)\setminus (B_r\setminus\{v_1\})} \frac{\left(\log^{(t-2)} k\right)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)} \gamma(v)\right)^{\gamma(v)}} \enspace .
\]
Then there exists an integer constant $a>0$ such that,
if
\begin{equation}
     n_r \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)} (c + s)\right)^{c+s}} \enspace ,
 \label{total-weight-i}
\end{equation}
where
\[
    s := \frac{\log c}{\log^{(t-1)} c}
\]
and if $\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_t'$ are distinct integers, each greater than $a(k-c-1)$,
then $H$ has a 2-ranking $\varphi:V(H)\to\N$ such that
\begin{compactenum}[(P1)]
    \item for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,{t'}\}$, $\varphi(v_i)=\phi_i$; and
    \item for each $v\in V(H)\setminus B_r$, $a(k-\gamma(v)-1) < \varphi(v) \le a(k-c-1)$.
\end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    For each node $x\in V(T)$, let $T_x$ denote the subtree of $T$ induced by $x$ and all its $T$-descendants and let $H_x:=H[\bigcup_{y\in V(T_x)} B_y]$. Recall that, for $x\neq r$, $B_x$ contains exactly one vertex $v_1'$ that is not present in $B_p$ where $p$ is the $T$-parent of $x$.  Define
    \[
        n_x:=\sum_{v\in V(H_x)\setminus (B_x\setminus \{v_1'\})}\frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)}\gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}} \enspace .
    \]
    Note that, when $x=r$, this coincides with the definition of $n_r$ in the statement of the lemma (with $v_1'=v_1$).

    The proof is by induction on $|H|$.  In the base case, $1\le|H|\le t$, in which case $T$ has only one node $r$. For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,t'\}$, we set $\varphi(v_i):=\phi_i$, in order to satisfy (P1).  In this case Condition (P2) is vacuous since it does not apply to vertices in $B_r$.

    Now assume $|H|\ge t+1$, so $|T|=|H|-t+1\ge 2$.  We say that node $x$ of $T$ is \emph{heavy} if
    \begin{equation}
        n_v > \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)}\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)\right)^{c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}}} \enspace , \label{heavy-def}
    \end{equation}
    and $v$ is \emph{light} otherwise.  For a heavy node $v$,
    \begin{align*}
        (\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/n_v & < \left(\log^{(t-2)}\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)\right)^{c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}} \\
        & = \left(\log^{(t-2)}(c+s)\right)^{\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)
            \left(\tfrac{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s+\log(c+s)/\log^{(t-1)}(c+s))}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)} \\
            & \qquad\qquad\text{(change of base)} \\
        & < (\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)
            \left(1 + \tfrac{\log(c+s)/\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}{\prod_{j=0}^{t-1}\log^{(j)}(c+s)}\right)} \\
            & \qquad\qquad\text{(by \cref{logi-ratio})}\\
        & = (\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)
            \left(1 + \tfrac{1}{(c+s)\cdot\left(\prod_{j=2}^{t-1}\log^{(j)}(c+s)\right)\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)} \\
            & \qquad\qquad\text{(for $t\ge 2$)}\\
        & \le (\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{\left(c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)
            \left(1 + \tfrac{1}{(c+s)\cdot \log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)} \\
            & \qquad\qquad\text{($c\ge \tau(t-1)$, so $\textstyle \prod_{j=2}^{t-1}\log^{(j)}c\ge 1$)} \\
        & = (\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)} +
            \tfrac{1}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)} + \tfrac{\log(c+s)}{(c+s)(\log^{(t-1)}(c+s))^2}}  \\
        & = (\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)} + O\left(\frac{1}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}\right)}  \\
        & = (\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{c+s}\cdot (c+s)\cdot O_c(1) \\
        & = O\left(c\cdot\left(\log^{(t-2)}(c+s)\right)^{c+s}\right) \enspace ,
        \numberthis \label{sizer}
    \end{align*}
    since $c+s\in O(c)$.
    Let $T'$ be the subtree of $T$ induced by the set of heavy nodes and let $L$ be the set of leaves in $T'$.  Observe that, for any two distinct leaves $x,y\in L$, $V(H_x)\cap V(H_y)=B_x\cap B_y$.  If follows that $n_r\ge \sum_{x\in L} n_x\ge |L|\cdot(\ref{heavy-def})$.  Therefore the number of leaves in $T'$ is
    \[
        |L| \le \frac{n_v}{(\ref{heavy-def})} \le \frac{(\ref{sizer})}{\left(\log^{(t-2)}(c+s)\right)^{c+s}} = O(c)
    \]

    Let $H':=H[\bigcup_{x\in V(T')} B_x]$ and notice that $\mathcal{T}':=(B_x:x\in V(T'))$ is a $(t-1)$-simple tree decomposition of $H'$. The tree $T'$ has $O(c)$ leaves and therefore has at most $O(c)$ branching nodes. By \cref{skeleton-size}, the $\mathcal{T}'$-skeleton $\hat{H'}$ of $H'$ is a simple $(t-1)$-tree and $|\hat{H}'|\in O(c)$.  By \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a} applied to the $(t-1)$-tree $\hat{H}'$,
    \[
       \trn(\hat{H}')\in
       O\left(\frac{\log|\hat{H}'|}{\log^{(t-1)}|\hat{H}'|}\right)
       \subseteq O\left(\frac{\log c}{\log^{(t-1)} c}\right) = O(s) \enspace .
    \]
    Therefore, $H'$ has a 2-ranking $\varphi:V(H')\to \{\lceil a(k-c-1)\rceil-r,\ldots,\lceil a(k-c-1)\rceil-1\}$ for some $r\in O(s)$. Modifying $\varphi$ so that it colours $\varphi(v_i):=\phi_i$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,t\}$ preserves the fact that $\varphi$ is a 2-ranking, since $\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_t$ are all distinct and each greater than $a(k-c-1)$.

    The colouring $\varphi$ of $H'$ is a partial colouring of $H$. By definition, $\varphi$ satisifies requirement (P1). For a sufficiently large constant $a$, $\lceil a(k-c-1)\rceil-r >  a(k-c-s-1)+1$, so each vertex in $H'$ receives a colour larger than $a(k-c-s-1)+1$.  For any vertex $v\in V(H)\setminus (B_r\setminus \{v_1\})$,
    \[ \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)}\gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}}
         \le n_r
         \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)}(c+s))^{(c+s)}}
    \]
    so $\gamma(v)\ge c+s$, so the partial colouring $\varphi$ satisifies requirement (P2).

   Now, $T-T'$ is a forest of trees $T_1,\ldots,T_m$ rooted at nodes $r_1,\ldots,r_m$, respectively.
   For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$, $r_i$ is light, so
   \[
       n_{r_i} \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{
        \left(
            \log^{(t-2)}
                \left(
                   c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}
               \right)
        \right)^{\left(
           c+s+\tfrac{\log(c+s)}{\log^{(t-1)}(c+s)}
       \right)}
       }
   \]
   Therefore, we can apply \cref{t-tree-slack} inductively on each graph $H_{r_1},\ldots,H_{r_m}$ since each of these graphs is smaller than $H$ and each satisfies \cref{total-weight-i} with the value $c'=c+s$.
   Consider one particular such graph $H_{r_j}$ and let $v_1',\ldots,v_t'$ denote the vertices of $B_{r_j}$.  The vertices $v_2',\ldots,v_t'$ appear in $H'$ and have already received colours $\phi_2',\ldots,\phi_t':=\varphi(v_2'),\ldots,\varphi(v_t')$ each greater than $a(k-c'-1)+1$.  The vertex $v_1'$ has not been assigned a colour yet and it can receive colour $\phi_1':=\lceil a(k-c'-1)\rceil+1$.  Applying the inductive hypothesis colours the remaining vertices $V(H_{r_i})\setminus B_{r_i}$ using colours no greater than $a(k-c'-1)$.  Doing this for each of $H_{r_1},\ldots,H_{r_m}$ completes the colouring $\varphi$ to a total colouring of $H$.

   All that remains is to verify that $\varphi$ is a 2-ranking of $H$. To see this, consider any length-2 path $uvw$ in $H$.  We must show that $\varphi(u)\neq \varphi(w)$ or $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$.  There are a few cases to consider:
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $\varphi(u)=\varphi(w) \ge a(k-c'-1)$ then $\{u,w\}\subseteq V(H')$. Either
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item $v\in V(H')$ in which case $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$ since $\varphi$ is a 2-ranking of $H'$ (by the application of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}) to $H'$; or
       \item $v\in V(H_{r_i})\setminus V(H')$ for some $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$.  This case is not possible.  Since $v\not\in V(H')$, there is no $x\in V(T')$ with $v\in B_x$.  But this implies that both $u$ and $w$ are contained in $B_{r_i}$, so $uw\in E(H')$, so $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$ since $\varphi$ is a 2-ranking and therefore a proper colouring of $H'$.
   \end{enumerate}
   \item If $\varphi(u)=\varphi(w) < a(k-c'-1)$ then $u\in V(H_{r_i})\setminus V(H')$ and $w\in V(H_{r_j})\setminus V(H')$.  Either
   \begin{enumerate}
    \item $v\in V(H')$ in which case $\varphi(v)>a(k-c'-1)\ge\varphi(u)$; or
    \item $v\not\in V(H')$ in which case $i=j$ and $v\in V(H_{r_i})$ so $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$ (by the application of induction on $H_{r_i}$). \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

The next lemma helps deal with the case where we don't necessarily have the slack $s$ required to apply \cref{t-tree-slack}.  In this case we use the top $O(c)$ colours (which we can only use once) as a separator, $S$, to colour a subgraph $H'$ of $H$ so that each $(t-1)$-tree in the uncoloured $(t-1)$-forest $H-H'$ has the slack needed to apply \cref{t-tree-slack}.

\begin{lem}\label{t-tree-no-slack-separator}
    Let $t,k\in\N$ and $c\in\R$ with $t\ge 2$ and $\tau(t)\le c\le k-1$; let $H$ be a simple $(t-1)$-tree; let $t':=\min\{t, |H|\}$; let $v_1,\ldots,v_{|H|}$ be a construction order for $H$ generating a canonical tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}:=(B_x:x\in V(T))$ of $H$ rooted at $r\in V(T)$; let $\gamma:V(H)\to\{z\in\N: z\ge \tau(t-1)\}$; and let
    \[
        n_H:=\sum_{v\in V(H)} \frac{\left(\log^{(t-2)} k\right)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)} \gamma(v)\right)^{\gamma(v)}} \enspace .
    \]
    There exists an integer constant $a>0$ such that,
    if
    \begin{equation}
         n_H \in O\left( \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} c)^{c}} \right)\enspace ,
     \label{total-weight-ii}
    \end{equation}
    then there exists $S_T\subseteq V(T)$ defining $S:=\bigcup_{x\in S_T} B_x$ such that
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item $|S_T|\in O(c+1)$ and therefore $|S|\le (t+1)|S_T|\in O(c+1)$; and
        \item For each component $X$ of $H-S$,
        \[
            n_X:=\sum_{v\in V(X)} \frac{\left(\log^{(t-2)} k\right)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)} \gamma(v)\right)^{\gamma(v)}}
            \le n_0 :=
            \frac{\left(\log^{(t-2)} k\right)^k}{\left(\log^{(t-2)} (c+s)\right)^{c+s}}
        \]
        where $s:=\log c/\log^{(t+1)} c$.
    \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    We say that a subgraph $H'$ of $H$ is \emph{heavy} if    $n_{H'}:=\sum_{v\in V(H')} > n_0$ and, $H'$ is \emph{light}, otherwise.
    A computation similar to \cref{sizer} (but slightly simpler) shows that
    % \begin{align*}
    %     \frac{\left(\log^{(t-2)} k\right)^k}{n_{0}}
        % & < \left(\log^{(t-2)}\left(c+\tfrac{\log c}{\log^{(t-1)} c}\right)\right)^{c+\tfrac{\log c}{\log^{(t-1)} c}} \\

        % \right)}  \\
        % & = \left(\log^{(t-2)}c\right)^{\left(c+\tfrac{\log c}{\log^{(t-1)} c}
        %   + O_c\left(\tfrac{1}{\log^{(t-1)} c}\right)

        n_H/n_0 \in O(c) \enspace . \label{heavy-size}
    \end{equation}

    For a subtree $T'$ of $T$, let $n_{T'}:=n_{H[\bigcup_{x\in V(T')}B_x]}$ and observe that $n_T=n_H$.
    Let $T^{(0)}:=T$, let $i:=0$ and repeat the following steps until
    $n_{T^{(i)}} < n_0$:
    \begin{compactenum}
        \item Find a node $x_{i}\in V(T^{(i)})$ of maximal $T^{(i)}$-depth such that the subtree $T^{(i)}_{x_i}$ of $T^{(i)}$ containing $x_i$ and its $T^{(i)}$-descendants has $n_{T^{(i)}_{x_i}} > n_0$.

        \item Set $T^{(i+1)}$ to be the component of $T^i-\{x_i\}$ containing $r$ and set $i:=i+1$.
    \end{compactenum}
    The key observation is that, since $x_i$ is of maximal depth, each component $X$ of $T^{(i)}-\{x_i\}$ other than $T^{(i+1)}$ has $n_X\le n_0$.
    This procedure certainly terminates after $r\le n_T/n_0 = n_H/n_0 \in O(c)$ steps and the set $S_T:=\{x_0,\ldots,x_r\}$ has the required properties.
\end{proof}

We are now ready to prove the technical statement that implies \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}. Note that in the following statement $H$ is a $t$-tree, no longer a $(t-1)$-tree.  This is the whole enchilada:


\begin{lem}\label{two-tree-technical}
    For every fixed positive integer $t$ there exist an integer constant $a>0$ such that, for every integer $k\ge \tau(t)$, every $n\le (\log^{(t-2)} k)^{k}$, and every $n$-vertex simple $t$-tree $H$, $\trn(H)\le ak$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    Assume $n\ge t+1$, otherwise the result is obtained trivially for any $a\ge t+1$ by colouring each vertex of $H$ with a distinct colour.

    Let $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ be a construction order for $H$ and let $L_0,\ldots,L_m$ be a BFS layering of $H$ with $L_0=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{t}\}$.
    For each $v\in V(H)$, let $\ell(v)$ be such that $v\in L_{\ell(v)}$.
    For each $t$-clique $C$ in $H[L_i]$, we use $H_C$ to denote the connected component of $H[C\cup\bigcup_{j=i+1}^m L_j]$ that contains $C$.
    For each vertex $v\in L_i$, let $N_i(v)$ denote the set of $t$-cliques in $H[L_i]$ that contain $v$ and let $H^+_v:=H[\bigcup_{C\in N_i(v)} H_C]-L_i$.  In words, $H^+_v$ is the set of all $t$-trees hanging off all the $t$-cliques of $H_i$ that contain $v$.  Let $n_v:=\tau(t-1)+|H^+_v|$.  For each $v\in L_i$, we set $\gamma(v)$ to be the solution to the equation $(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} \gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)} = n_v$.

    \begin{clm}\label{size-claim}
        For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$ and each component $H'$ of $H[\bigcup_{j=i}^m L_j]$,
        \[
            |H'| \le \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])} n_v = \tau(t-1)\cdot|H'[L_i] |+ t\cdot|H'-L_i|
            \le \tau(t-1)\cdot|H'| \enspace .
        \]
    \end{clm}

    \begin{proof}
        The two inequalities in the result are obvious, so we need only show the equality in the middle.
        Each vertex of $H'-L_i$ is contained $H_C$ for exactly one $t$-clique $C$ of $H'[L_i]$.  Therefore,
        \begin{align*}
            |H'-L_i|
            & = \sum_{C\in H'[L_i]} |H_C-L_i| \\
            & = \sum_{C\in H'[L_i]}\sum_{v\in C} |H_C-L_i|/t \\
            & = \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])}\sum_{C\in N_i(v)} |H_C-L_i|/t \\
            & = \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])}|H^+_v|/t \enspace ,
        \end{align*}
        so
        \[  \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])} n_v = \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])}(\tau(t-1)+|H^+_v|)
          = \tau(t-1)\cdot|H'[L_i]| + t\cdot|H'-L_i| \enspace . \qedhere
        \]
    \end{proof}

    The following technical claim essentially implies \cref{two-tree-technical}, that is suitable for induction the layer.

    \begin{clm}\label{main-claim}
        Let $H'$ be the union of one or more connected components of $H[\bigcup_{j=i}^m L_i]$. There exists a constant $a$ such that, if
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])} n_v\le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^{k}}{(\log^{(t-2)} (c+s))^{c+s}} \enspace , \label{main-size}
        \end{equation}
        where $s:=\log c/\log^{(t-1)} c$,
        then there exists $\varphi:V(H')\to\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ and $\psi:V(H')\to\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$ such that
        \begin{compactenum}[(P1)]
            \item The function $\theta:V(H')\to\{1,\ldots,3tak\}$ defined by $\theta(v)=3t\varphi(v) - 3\psi(v) -(\ell(v)\bmod 3)$ is a 2-ranking of $H'$;
            \item for each $v\in V(H'[L_i])$, $\psi(v)=0$; and
            \item for each $v\in V(H'[L_i])$, $\varphi(v)\le a(k-c-1)$.
        \end{compactenum}
    \end{clm}

    \begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{main-claim}]
        In all cases, (P2) requires setting $\psi(v)=0$ for all $v\in V(H'[L_i])$, so we do this now and will not mention it again.  Since $H$ is a simple $t$-tree, \cref{simple-bfs-layers} implies that $\stw(H'[L_i])\le \stw(H[L_i])\le t-1$.  By \cref{simple-subgraph}, we may assume that $H'[L_i]$ is a simple $(t-1)$-tree.

        The proof is by induction on $m-i$. In the base case $m-i=0$ and $H'$ is a $(t-1)$-forest.  Then, for each $v\in L_i$, $n_v=\tau(t-1)$.  Then
        \begin{align*}
            \sum_{v\in V(H')} \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} \gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}}
            & = \sum_{v\in V(H')} n_v \\
            % & = \tau(t-1)\cdot|H'| \\
            % & \le \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])} n_v  & \text{(by \cref{size-claim})}\\
            & \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^{k}}{(\log^{(t-2)} c)^c} & \text{(by \cref{main-size})} \enspace .
        \end{align*}
        Applying \cref{t-tree-slack} to $H'[L_i]$ gives a colouring $\varphi: V(H')\to\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ that satisfies (P1) and (P3).  This handles the case $m=i$.

        For the inductive step, $m-i\ge 1$.
        Now,
        \[
            \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])}\frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} \gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}}
            = \sum_{v\in V(H'[L_i])} n_v
            \le \frac{(\log^{(t-2)} k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} (c+s))^{c+s}} \enspace .
        \]
       Therefore $\gamma$ satisfies the requirements for \cref{t-tree-slack}, so we can find a 2-ranking of the $(t-1)$-forest $H'[L_i]$ that satisfies (P3) and satisfies (P1), at least for the graph $H'[L_i]$. In addition $\varphi(v)> a(k-c-\gamma(v)-1)$ for each $v\in V(H'[L_i])$.  It remains to show that we can extend $\varphi$ to a complete colouring of $H'$.

       The next step is use \cref{t-tree-no-slack-separator} to break $H'-L_i$ into sufficiently small components.  For any $v\in H'[L_{i]}]$, define
       \begin{align*}
          n_{H^+_v} & := \sum_{w\in V(H^+_v)[L_{i+1}]} n_w \\
                    & \le \tau(t-1)\cdot|H^+_v| & \text{(by \cref{size-claim})} \\
                    & \le \tau(t-1)\cdot n_v & \text{(by \cref{size-claim})} \\
                    & = \tau(t-1)\cdot\left(\frac{(\log^{(t-2)}k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)}\gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}}\right)
                    & \text{(by definition of $\gamma(v)$)} \\
                    & \in O\left(\frac{(\log^{(t-2)}k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)}\gamma(v))^{\gamma(v)}}\right) &\text{(for $t\in O(1)$)}
       \end{align*}
       Therefore, $\gamma$ satisifies the conditions for applying \cref{t-tree-no-slack-separator} to $H^+_v[L_{i+1}]$.  Therefore, there exists a set $S_v\subseteq H^+_v[L_{i+1}]$ of size $O(\gamma(v)+1)$ such that each component $X$ of $H^+_v-S_v$ has $n_X\le (\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} (\gamma(v))+s(v))^{\gamma(v)+s(v)}$, where $s(v):=\log\gamma(v)/\log^{(t-1)}\gamma(v)$.

       Let $\zeta:V(H'[L_i])\to\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$ be a proper colouring of $H'[L_i]$.  Assign each of the vertices in $S_v$ a distinct colour $\varphi(w)$ from the set $\{\lfloor a(k-\gamma(v))\rfloor+1,\ldots,ak\}$.  In addition, assign $\psi(w):=\zeta(v)$.  Note that, if we do this for each $v\in V(H'[L_i])$ there may be some vertices $w\in L_{i+1}$ that are assigned colours $\varphi(w)$ and $\psi(w)$ more than once.  In this case, we arbitrarily choose one of the vertices $v\in H'[L_i]$ such that $w\in S_v$ and use the colours $\varphi(w)$ and $\psi(w)$ assigned to $w$ by $v$.

       Recall that, for each vertex $w$ in $L_{i+1}$, the \emph{dominant parent} $p(w)$ of $w$ is in $L_i$ (\cref{dominant-parent}).  In particular, for any $w\in V(H'[L_{i+1}])$, $p(w)\in V(H'[L_{i}])$.
       For each vertex $v$ in $H'[L_i]$ we define $D_v:=\{w\in H'[L_{i+1}]: p(w)=v\}$.  For each $v\in V(H'[L_i])$, define the graph $H_v$ to be the component of $H'[D_v\cup \bigcup_{j=i+2}^m L_j]$ that contains $D_v$.  Note that $H_v$ is a subgraph of $H^+_v$.

       There are some vertices $w$ in $H_v[L_{i+1}]$ that have already been assigned colours $\varphi(w)$ and $\psi(w)$ because $w\in S_{v'}$ for some $v'\in V(H'[L_i])$.  Consider the \emph{uncoloured graph} $H^-_v:=H_v-\bigcup_{v'\in V(H'[L_i])} S_{v'}$.  Since $H^-_v\subseteq H_v\subseteq H^+_v$, any component $Y$ of $H^-_v$ has $n_Y\le (\log^{(t-2)} k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} (\gamma(v))+s(v))^{\gamma(v)+s(v)}$.  Furthermore, if $Y$ is a subgraph of $H_C$ for some $t$-clique $C$ in $H'[L_i]$, then
       \begin{equation}
        n_Y \le \min_{v'\in C}\left(\frac{(\log^{(t-2)}k)^k}{(\log^{(t-2)} (\gamma(v'))+s(v'))^{\gamma(v')+s(v')}} \right) \enspace . \label{min}
        \end{equation}
       Again, this is because $Y\subseteq Y^+$ where $Y^+$ is a component of $H_C\subseteq H^+_{v'}$ and each component $Y'$ of $H^+_{v'}-S_{v'}$ has $n_{Y'}\le (\log^{(t-2)}k)^k/(\log^{(t-2)} (\gamma(v'))+s(v'))^{\gamma(v')+s(v')}$.

       We apply the inductive hypothesis to each component $Y$ of $H^-_v$ and we obtain $\varphi:V(H^-_v)\to\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ and $\psi:V(H_w)\to\{0,1\}$ that satisfy the conditions of the claim.  We do this to colour $H^-_v$ for each $v\in V(H'[L_i])$.

       At this point colourings $\varphi:V(H')\to\{1,\ldots,ak\}$ and $\psi:V(H')\to\{0,1\}$ are completely defined.  We must, however, make one small modification to $\psi$.  Since each vertex in $H'[L_{i+1}]$ is coloured by induction on some component of $H^-_v$ for some $v\in V(H'[L_i])$, $\psi(w)=0$ for each $w\in V(H'[L_{i+1}])$, and we are free to change this.
       % Now, the graph $H'[L_i]$ is a $(t-1)$-forest and therefore has a proper $t$-colouring $\zeta:V(H'[L_i])\to\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$.
       Recall that $\zeta:V(H'[L_i])\to\{0,\ldots,t-1\}$ is a proper $t$-colouring of $H'[L_i]$.  For each vertex $v$ in $H'[L_i]$ and each vertex $w$ in $H^-_v[L_{i+1}]$ we set $\psi(w):=\zeta(v)=\zeta(p(w))$.  This completes the description of the colourings $\varphi$ and $\psi$.

       We have already ensured that $\varphi$ and $\psi$ satisfy (P2) and (P3). All that remains is to ensure that they satisfy (P1).  To do this, consider some path $uvw$ in $H'$.  We must show that $\theta(u)\neq\theta(w)$ or $\theta(u)<\theta(v)$.  There are a few cases to consider (see \cref{cases}):

       \begin{compactenum}
          \item If $u\in L_i$ and $w\in L_j$ for $i\neq j$ then $i\bmod 3\neq j\bmod 3$, so $\theta(u)\neq\theta(w)$.

          \item If $u,w\in L_i$ and $v\in L_{i+1}$ then $u,w$ is contained in the parent clique $C_v$ of $v$.  In particular, $uw\in E(H'[L_i])$ so $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$ since \cref{t-tree-slack} produces a 2-ranking (which is a proper colouring) $\varphi$ of $H'[L_i]$.

          \item If $u,v,w\in L_i$ then $uvw$ is completely contained in $H'[L_i]$ and $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$ or $\varphi(u)<\varphi(v)$ because \cref{t-tree-slack} produces a 2-ranking $\varphi$ of $H'[L_i]$.

          \item If $uw\in E(H^-_p)$ or the path $u,v,w\in V(H^-_p)$ for some vertex $p$ in $H'[L_i]$ then the inductive hypothesis ensures that $\theta$ was already a 2-ranking of $H^-_v$ and the subsequent modifications to $\psi(w)$ for $w\in H^-_v[L_{i+1}]$ do not change this. In fact, these modifications do not change the relative order of $\theta(u)$ and $\theta(w)$ or the relative order of $\theta(u)$ and $\theta(v)$.

          \item If $u,w\in V(H^-_p)$ for some $p\in V(H'[L_i])$, $v$ is in $H'[L_i]$, and $v\neq p$ then, by \cref{up-clique}, $pv\in E(H'[L_i])$.  Therefore, there exists a $t$-clique $C$ in $H'[L_i]$ with $\{p,v\}\subseteq C_u$ such that $u\in V(H_{C})$.  The vertex $u$ is contained in some component $Y$ of $H^-_v$. By \cref{min} and the application of \cref{t-tree-slack} to $Y$, $\varphi(u)\le a(k-\gamma(v)-1) < \varphi(v)$ so $\theta(u) < \theta(v)$.

          \item If $u\in V(H^-_{p})$, $v\in V(H'[L_i])$ and $w\in V(H^-_q)$ for some $p\neq q$, then $p=p(v)$ and $q=p(w)$.  By \cref{up-clique}, the edge $pq\in E(H[L_i])$, so $\psi(u)=\zeta(p)\neq\zeta(q)=\psi(w)$ since $\zeta$ is a proper colouring of $H'[L_i]$.

          \item If $u,w\in V(H_{p}-H^-_{p})$ for some $p\in V(H'[L_i])$ then $\varphi(u)$ and $\psi(u)$ were assigned by some vertex $p'\in V(H'[L_i])$ such that $v\in S_{p'}$.  Similarly, $\varphi(w)$ and $\psi(w)$ were assigned by some vertex $q'\in V(H'[L_i])$ such that $w\in S_{q'}$.  There are two subcases to consider:
          \begin{compactenum}
            \item If $p'=q'$ then $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(q)$ since every vertex in $S_{p'}$ is assigned a unique colour by $\varphi$.
            \item If $p'\neq q'$ then, by \cref{up-clique}, $p'q'\in E(H'[L_i])$ so that $\psi(u)=\zeta(p')\neq\zeta(q')=\psi(w)$.
        \end{compactenum}
        In either case $\theta(u)\neq\theta(w)$.

        \item If $u,w\in H_p[L_{i+1}]$, $u\in V(H^-_{p})$ and $w\not\in V(H^-_{p})$ for some $p\in V(H'[L_i])$ then $w\in S_{q'}$ for some $q'\in V(H'[L_i])$ and $\varphi(w)$ (and $\psi(w)$) was assigned by $q'$, so $\varphi(w)>a(k-\gamma(q')-1)$. On the other hand, by \cref{min}, $\varphi(u) \le a(k-\gamma(q')-1)$.  Therefore $\varphi(u)<\varphi(w)$ so $\theta(u)\neq\theta(w)$.
      \end{compactenum}
      This completes the proof of \cref{main-claim}.
    \end{proof}
    Finally, to complete the proof of \cref{two-tree-technical} we apply \cref{main-claim} with $i=0$ and $H'=H$.  By \cref{size-claim} we can do this with any value $k$ such that $\tau(t-1)\cdot n \le (\log k)^{k}$ to show that $\trn(H)\le \tau(t-1)\cdot a\cdot k$ for some constant $a$.
\end{proof}

Rewriting \cref{two-tree-technical} in terms of $n$ yields \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}:

\begin{proof}[Proof of \weirdref{simple-t-trees}{a}]
    By \cref{two-tree-technical}, $\trn(H)\in O(k)$ for any $k$ that satisfies
    \[  (\log^{(t-2)} k)^{k} \ge n \Leftrightarrow
        k \ge \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t-1)} k}
    \]
    Taking $k=2\log n/\log^{(t)} n$, this becomes
    \[
        \frac{2\log n}{\log^{(t)} n}
        \ge \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t-1)}(\log n + 2 -\log^{(t)} n)}
        = \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t)} n - O(1/\log n)}
        = \frac{\log n}{\log^{(t)} n}+O(1) \enspace .
    \]
    which is clearly true for all sufficiently large $n$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Bounded Genus Graphs}

We now prove the upper bound in \cref{bounded-genus}. To do this, we make use of the following product structure theorem of \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}:\footnote{\citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar} state a version of \cref{product-structure} that describes $H$ as an apex graph of treewidth at most $4$.  By definition, this means that $H$ has an apex vertex $v_0$ such that $H-\{v_0\}$ is planar.  It is not hard to see that the removal of $v_0$ also reduces the treewidth of $H$ to 3, yielding the version of \cref{product-structure-genus} stated here.}

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}] \label{product-structure-genus}
    For every $n$-vertex graph $G$ of Euler genus at most $g$, there exists some at most $n$-vertex path $P$, some at most $n$-vertex graph $H$, and a vertex $v_0\in V(H)$ such that $H-\{v_0\}$ is a planar 3-tree and $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes K_{\max\{2g,3\}}\boxtimes P$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{bounded-genus}]
    Apply \cref{product-structure-genus} to $G$ to obtain the graph $H$, path $P$, and apex vertex $v_0\in V(H)$.  By \cref{planar} there exists a 2-ranking $\varphi:V(H-\{v_0\})\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$ with $k\in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$. Setting $\varphi(v_0):=k+1$ then gives a 2-ranking of $H$, so $\trn(H)\le k+1\in O(\log n/\log^{(3)} n)$.  The same argument used in the proof of \cref{dumb} to show that $\dtcn(K_3\boxtimes P)\le 9$ shows that $\dtcn(K_{\max\{2g,3\}}\boxtimes P)\le 3\max\{2g+3\}$.  \cref{bounded-genus} now follows from \cref{product-lemma}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Other Graph Families with Product Structure}

As noted in the introduction, several other families of graphs are known to have product structure theorems like \cref{product-structure,product-structure-genus}.  In particular, \citet{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar} show:

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.joret.ea:planar}]\label{apex-minor-free}
    For any apex graph $A$, there exists a value $t$ such that any $n$-vertex $A$-minor free graph $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$ where $H$ is an at most $n$-vertex graph of treewidth at most $t$ and $P$ is a path.
\end{thm}

\citet{dujmovic.morin.ea:structure} show a similar result for some non-minor-closed families of graphs, the most well-known of which are the $k$-planar graphs:

\begin{thm}[\cite{dujmovic.morin.ea:structure}]\label{gk-planar}
    For any integers $g$ and $k$, there exists a value $t$ such that any $n$-vertex $(g,k)$-planar graph $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$, where $H$ is an at most $n$-vertex graph of treewidth at most $t$ and $P$ is a path.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{meta}]
    For any $n$-vertex member $G$ of these graph families, \cref{gk-planar,apex-minor-free} show that $G$ is a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$ with $\tw(H)\le t$.  \Cref{product-lemma,t-trees} and the fact taht $\trn(P)\le 3$ then imply \cref{meta}.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion}
\label{conclusion}

We have given asymptotically optimal bounds on the number of colours required by $2$-rankings of $n$-vertex $t$-trees, planar 3-trees, outerplanar graphs, and planar graphs.  Prior to this work, the best known bounds were $\Omega(n/\log n)$ (trees) and $O(\log n)$.

Our upper bounds are constructive and lead to $O(n)$ time algorithms for finding $2$-rankings of $t$-trees, planar 3-trees, and outerplanar graphs.  For planar graphs, we require an algorithic version of \cref{product-structure}. Currently, the fastest such algorithm runs in $O(n\log n)$ time \cite{morin:fast}.

Two directions for future work stand out:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item This paper settles many questions related to $2$-ranking.  How much (if any) of this can be extended to $\ell$-ranking for $\ell>2$?
    \item For constant $d$, the lower and upper bounds for 2-ranking $d$-degenerate graphs are $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$, respectively.  Closing this gap is an intriguing open problem.
\end{inparaenum}
